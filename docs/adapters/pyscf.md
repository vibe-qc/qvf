# PySCF adapter

`qvf.adapters.pyscf` writes molecular PySCF SCF/DFT and closed-shell
excited-state results as QVF archives (WP-62). It is the second independent producer of
`wavefunction.gto` beside vibe-qc, and it uses only existing QVF v1 kinds and
members: no format change. The adapter is unreleased and is not included in
toolkit v0.6.0. From a checkout containing it, install the optional dependency
and validator support:

```sh
pip install -e 'python/[pyscf,validate]'  # PySCF 2.14 or later, and NumPy
```

`import qvf.adapters.pyscf` works without PySCF; calling an export function
then raises an `ImportError` that names the extra. Pure convention helpers
such as `real_solid_harmonics` do not need the chemistry engine.

For a runnable first calculation and installed-package checks, follow the
[PySCF-to-QVF tutorial](../tutorials/pyscf-to-qvf.md). The adapter is included
in the prepared Python package candidate `0.7.0rc1`; that candidate is separate
from the existing toolkit v0.6.0 tag.

## SCF example

```python
from pyscf import dft, gto, scf
from qvf import Reader, validate_qvf
from qvf.adapters.pyscf import write_scf

mol = gto.M(atom="O 0 0 0.1173; H 0 0.7572 -0.4692; H 0 -0.7572 -0.4692",
            basis="def2-svp")
mf = dft.RKS(mol, xc="pbe0").run()
write_scf(mf, "water.qvf")
assert validate_qvf("water.qvf")["findings"] == []

oh = gto.M(atom="O 0 0 0; H 0 0 0.97", basis="def2-svp", spin=1, cart=True)
write_scf(scf.UHF(oh).run(), "oh-uhf-cartesian.qvf")

with Reader("water.qvf") as reader:
    wf = reader.get("wf")
    C = wf.coefficients().numpy()              # [n_mo, n_ao], QVF AO order
    S = reader.tensor("wf", "overlap").numpy()
    print(abs(C @ S @ C.T).max())              # orthonormal orbitals
```

To add the sections to a writer you already have, use
`add_scf(writer, mf)`, or the single steps `add_structure`, `add_wavefunction`,
`add_populations`, `add_job_spec` and `set_scf_provenance`; the
[Python API reference](../api/python.md) lists their options.

## What is written

| PySCF | QVF |
|---|---|
| `mf.mol` geometry, `charge`, `spin` | `structure` (positions in Å from the bohr coordinates of the calculation, `charge`, `multiplicity = spin + 1`) |
| `RHF`/`RKS`, `ROHF`/`ROKS`, `UHF`/`UKS` orbitals | `wavefunction.gto`, `spin` `restricted`, `restricted_open` or `unrestricted` |
| AO basis (`mol.cart` false or true) | `basis` payload, `pure` true or false, on `N_i`-normalized primitives |
| `mo_coeff`, `mo_energy`, `mo_occ` | coefficients and `mo_metadata` (energies in hartree, occupations; point-group labels with `symmetry=True`) |
| `mol.intor('int1e_ovlp')` | `overlap`, in the QVF AO basis |
| `mf.make_rdm1()` | `density_matrix`, or `density_matrix_alpha` and `density_matrix_beta` |
| ECP core electrons | `basis.ecp` entries with `n_core_electrons` and the ECP name; no projectors yet |
| Mulliken and Löwdin analysis | `atom_properties`: `mulliken_charge`, `loewdin_charge`; open shells add `spin_population` (Mulliken α − β) |
| method, `xc`, basis name | `job.spec` (`functional` is `null` for Hartree–Fock), `provenance` |
| `e_tot`, `energy_nuc()` | `provenance.scf_energy`, root `energies` (`total`, `nuclear_repulsion`, `electronic`) |

Source program and version are PySCF's. A non-converged SCF is written with
`scf_converged: false` and `run_status: "failed"`.

The charges are computed from the archive's own density and overlap. For a
spherical basis the QVF AOs are PySCF's AOs up to order, so the values are
PySCF's own. For a Cartesian basis the Löwdin partition uses the AO
normalization of Appendix A.1 (axial components of unit norm).

## Excited states, spectra and NTOs

`write_td(td, path)` writes a completed molecular response calculation beside
its SCF reference. `add_td(writer, td)` adds the same sections to an open
writer. Both accept closed-shell RHF/RKS references and use existing QVF
`excited_states`, `spectra.uvvis` and `wavefunction.gto` kinds; there is no
new schema or archive version.

```python
from pyscf import dft, gto
from qvf import Reader
from qvf.adapters.pyscf import write_td

mol = gto.M(atom="H 0 0 0; H 0 0 0.74", basis="6-31g", verbose=0)
mf = dft.RKS(mol, xc="pbe0").run()
tda = mf.TDA().run(nstates=2)
ids = write_td(tda, "h2-tda.qvf")

with Reader("h2-tda.qvf") as reader:
    assert reader.validate()["ok"]
    payload = reader.json(ids["excited_states"], "states")
    for state in payload["states"]:
        print(state["index"], state["excitation_energy"], state["oscillator_strength"])
    hole_meta = reader.json(ids["nto_holes"][0], "mo_metadata")
    assert hole_meta["occupation_semantics"] == "transition_weight"

full = mf.TDDFT().run(nstates=2)
full_ids = write_td(full, "h2-tddft.qvf")
assert len(full_ids["nto_holes"]) == len(full.e)
with Reader("h2-tddft.qvf") as reader:
    assert reader.validate()["ok"]
    weights = reader.json(full_ids["nto_holes"][0], "mo_metadata")["occupations"]
    print(sum(weights))  # full-response weights are not rescaled to sum to one
```

| Source result | State table and UV-visible sticks | Paired NTOs |
|---|---|---|
| Singlet RHF/RKS TDA | Yes; RHF TDA is labelled `cis`, RKS TDA `tddft` with `tda: true` | Written by default |
| Singlet TDHF/TDDFT, including pure-functional Casida response | Yes; `tda: false` | Written by default, retaining X and Y |
| Triplet response from a closed-shell RHF/RKS reference | Yes; multiplicity 3, with PySCF's zero electric transition strengths | Omitted |
| Unrestricted or restricted-open reference, spin-flip, complex or periodic response | Refused | Refused |
| Solvent response or direct-RPA variants | Refused | Refused |

The state table preserves the source root order and numbers it from 1.
Excitation energies are converted from hartree to eV with QVF's conversion
constant; state totals are the SCF total plus each vertical excitation.
Transition dipoles are in atomic units and oscillator strengths use the
length gauge. Every occupied-to-virtual contribution is included, with
normalized `X²−Y²` weight; negative terms are retained. A frozen-orbital
mask maps these contributions back to rows of the **full** reference
wavefunction, including when frozen virtual orbitals make that map
non-contiguous. Spectrum peaks refer to these same state indices.

Root `provenance`, `energies` and the optional `job.spec` describe the **SCF
reference**. The response method and TDA flag belong to the excited-state
metadata. The reference job is not a complete request to repeat the response
calculation; `job_spec=False` omits it. Export does not run SCF/response
iterations or alter the molecule, orbitals, energies or X/Y arrays. It
requires a converged reference and converged roots, real finite data and
PySCF's original normalization `Σ(X²−Y²) = 1/2`. Invalid source results
are rejected before `write_td` opens its target.

For singlet TDA, the adapter factorizes the normalized transition matrix
`X / ||X||` by SVD. Squared singular values are the pair weights; the hole
and particle sections have corresponding rows, identical descending
weights, `state_ref` / `state_index` and zero orbital energies. The AO map
and overlap are the reference's. A pair reconstructs the source transition
in the occupied/virtual space, including its relative signs. See
R. L. Martin, *J. Chem. Phys.* **118**, 4775–4777 (2003),
[doi:10.1063/1.1558471](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1558471), eqs. 4–10,
and spec § 5.3.

For **singlet full response**, the matrix is instead
`T = sqrt(2) * (X + Y)`, in PySCF's restricted convention. Both amplitudes
contribute, and the squared singular-value weights retain their original
sum `2 * sum((X + Y)**2)`. That sum may be below or above one: do not
rescale it or interpret the weights as electron occupations or normalized
percentages. This uses QVF's existing allowance for non-unit full-response
weights (spec § 5.3), without a new field or validator rule.

This is the spin-adapted **spatial charge-transition** convention: it
represents the real, spin-independent Hermitian transition properties.
For a real symmetric one-electron operator `O`, the pair contraction is
`sqrt(2) * sum_k(sqrt(weight_k) * <hole_k|O|particle_k>)`. In particular,
it reconstructs PySCF's length-gauge transition dipole `2 * sum_ia((X+Y)_ia
* O_ia)`. It does not retain the separate X/Y blocks needed for
anti-Hermitian operators, such as the velocity-gauge momentum operator,
or define an excited-state difference density. The SVD of X+Y is described
by J. M. Herbert, *Density-functional theory for electronic excited states*,
in *Theoretical and Computational Photochemistry* (2023), eq. 3.51,
[doi:10.1016/B978-0-323-91738-4.00005-1](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-91738-4.00005-1).
The factor `sqrt(2)` converts PySCF's half-normalized restricted amplitudes
to the adapter's spatial convention. The accepted normalized TDA path is
unchanged. NTO signs within each pair retain the source transition's phase.

The adapter does **not** call PySCF 2.14's `get_nto`: that helper normalizes
the stored X array in place and ignores Y in full TDHF/TDDFT. `ntos=False`
omits NTOs; `ntos=True` requires a supported singlet result and otherwise
raises `NotImplementedError`. Triplet NTOs remain deferred: the charge
transition cancels between spins, and a spin-transition representation
must be mapped explicitly. Unrestricted and restricted-open response
also remain unsupported.

The returned IDs include the `add_scf` entries plus `excited_states`,
`spectrum`, `nto_holes` and `nto_particles`; the last two are ordered lists
and are empty when omitted. `states_id`, `spectrum_id` and `nto_prefix`
customize response IDs, while `add_scf` options customize reference IDs and
optional sections. All references use those selected IDs.

These APIs are unreleased. The output uses existing v0.6.0 schema fields,
but consumer display support remains specific to each application; see the
[family workflow](../family_workflow.md). Frozen consumer pins stay v0.6.0.

## How the AO conventions map

These are the three places where a PySCF archive could silently disagree with
another producer (spec [Appendix A](../../spec/qvf-format-spec.md#appendix-a-ao-ordering-primitive-normalization-and-component-naming)).

**Primitive normalization (A.1).** libcint stores each contraction
coefficient multiplied by the radial norm `gto_norm(l, α)` and the contraction
norm, and gives its Cartesian s and p functions the common factors `1/(2√π)`
and `√(3/(4π))`. The adapter takes the stored coefficient
(`mol.bas_ctr_coeff(ib) * gto.gto_norm(l, α)`), applies that factor, divides
by the Appendix A.1 `N_i`, and scales the contraction to a unit axial
self-overlap. Because `gto_norm(l, α) = N_i · √(4π/(2l+1))` for every
exponent, the result is PySCF's own contraction on `N_i`-normalized
primitives. A PySCF Cartesian AO with `l ≥ 2` has the norm `√(4π/(2l+1))`
(its `d_xx` has self-overlap 4π/5); in the archive it is divided by that, so
`⟨xx|xx⟩ = 1` and `⟨xy|xy⟩ = 1/3`, exactly as Appendix A.1 requires.

**In-shell order and phases (A.2).** PySCF's spherical `p` shell is
`x, y, z` and is permuted to `m = −1, 0, +1` (`y, z, x`). For `l ≥ 2` the
spec's harmonics are the conventional real solid harmonics: `cos(mφ)` for
`m > 0`, `sin(|m|φ)` for `m < 0`, no Condon–Shortley phase, each normalized
like the axial `x^l` (Helgaker, Jørgensen and Olsen, eqs. 6.4.47–6.4.50;
the convention of libint). The adapter does not assume that PySCF uses
them: it solves for the map from PySCF's `gto.cart2sph(l)` table onto
`real_solid_harmonics(l)`, refuses a basis whose map is not exact, and
writes the coefficients through that map. With PySCF 2.14 the table is
`√((2l+1)/(4π))` times the same harmonics in the same `m = −l … +l` order,
so the map is the identity for every `l ≥ 2`. Cartesian shells use libint's
lexicographic order in both programs.

**General contractions.** A PySCF shell with several contracted functions
(cc-pVDZ's s shells, for example) becomes one QVF shell per function, in
PySCF's AO order; primitives with a zero coefficient in that function are
left out.

All matrices are transformed with one block-diagonal AO map `T`
(`qvf.adapters.pyscf.ao_map(mol)`): `C_qvf = T C`, `P_qvf = T P Tᵀ` and
`S_qvf = T⁻ᵀ S T⁻¹`. The orbitals are therefore PySCF's orbitals, sign
included, and `C S Cᵀ = 1` holds in the archive.

## Checks

`python/tests/test_adapter_pyscf.py` (skipped without PySCF) writes water
RHF and RKS (PBE0, B3LYP) in def2-SVP and cc-pVDZ, spherical and Cartesian,
and the OH radical in UHF, UKS and ROHF. Every archive validates with no
finding, `E_NORMALIZATION` included; `C S Cᵀ = 1`; the populations add up to
the electron count; the stored densities equal PySCF's. An AO evaluator
written from Appendix A alone, with SciPy's spherical harmonics, reproduces
every PySCF orbital on random points, which also catches a sign or order
error inside a spherical shell that the overlap diagonal cannot see.
Candidate CI installs PySCF 2.14.0 on GitHub's
Python 3.14 job so these tests run; the Python 3.9 job keeps PySCF optional.

`scripts/pyscf_cross_producer.py REFERENCE.qvf` rebuilds the molecule of any
`wavefunction.gto` archive in PySCF, writes it with the adapter and compares
the SCF energy and the AO density matrix in the QVF AO convention. Against
vibe-qc archives (libint) of water RHF/def2-SVP, formaldehyde
RHF/def2-TZVP (with f shells) and the OH radical UHF/6-31G\*, the energies
agree to 3e-12 hartree and the densities to `max |ΔP|` ≈ 1e-8, the SCF
convergence level. The OH comparison starts PySCF from the reference density,
because the UHF π hole has two solutions of the same energy.

`python/tests/test_adapter_pyscf_td.py` checks response conversion separately:
RHF/RKS TDA and full response, the Casida class, triplet state tables,
spherical/Cartesian bases, rectangular NTO spaces and frozen MO indices.
It reads every archive back, checks validation, energies, transition
properties and references, reconstructs the TDA or full-response transition
and length-gauge moments from the stored NTOs, and verifies that source
arrays are unchanged. Explicit-Y controls catch X-only, X−Y and
unit-normalized mappings; cases retain weights both above and below a unit
sum. Error cases include
unconverged roots and X amplitudes changed by PySCF's NTO helper. These are
conversion checks, not a new scientific accuracy claim for either engine.

## Not yet covered

Later WP-62 tranches: unrestricted/open-shell response, triplet NTOs,
densities on a grid (`volume.density`) and periodic
Γ-point calculations. ECP projectors, solvent models (refused), GHF and
relativistic two-component wavefunctions (refused) and ghost atoms (refused)
are not mapped either.
