# QVF roadmap

Where the format and the toolkit are, and the order in which they grow. The
plan has two threads that run side by side: **the format** must be able to
carry every mainstream quantum-chemistry result without a vendor section, and
**the library** must be something any code links once and then writes, reads,
validates, and updates archives from C++, C, Fortran, Python, and more.

Three documents hold the detail:

| Document | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [`docs/format_review.md`](docs/format_review.md) | Coverage matrix, defects (D-nn), additive proposals (P-nn), v2 ledger (V2-nn), decisions needed |
| [`docs/library_design.md`](docs/library_design.md) | Target architecture and APIs of libqvf, bindings, packaging, testing |
| [`docs/work_packages.md`](docs/work_packages.md) | Self-contained implementation briefs (WP-nn) with Definition of Done, sized and ordered |

## Where we are (2026-10-26)

Phases 1 and the scheduled Phase 2 work are complete. Phase 0 still has
schema hosting (WP-06) open; the core of Phase 3 and the JavaScript reader
of Phase 4 have landed. Toolkit 0.5.0 collects WP-42, WP-43, WP-44, WP-46
and WP-47: C++/C/Python facades and a unified CLI, plus optional Fortran
bindings, cube/XYZ converters and native packaging improvements.
Toolkit 0.4.0 (2026-10-15) defines canonical unrestricted NTO pairing and
completes the v0.3.0 writer APIs while preserving deprecated archive input.
Toolkit 0.2.0 (2026-10-14) releases everything since 0.1.0, with
the sketch-document decisions taken for vibe-sketch on top. Toolkit 0.3.0
(2026-10-15) makes this repository the single source of the format for the
vibe-qc family and merges what its programs already wrote or read.

- ✅ Normative **specification** + machine-readable **JSON Schema**, drift-guarded; every JSON member payload has a schema definition and every unit a name (§ 4.3 vocabulary).
- ✅ Kinds for forces, Hessians, energy components, excited states and NTOs, transition densities, ECPs, overlap and density matrices, two-component wavefunctions, vector / complex / series / Laplacian volumes with periodic-grid semantics, periodic MD trajectories, electric / elastic / dielectric properties, FAIR root metadata, typed provenance and job specs, container rules (`size`, in-place updates, `byte_order`), and provisional `wavefunction.bloch`.
- ✅ Reference **writers** in Python and C++17 (zero-dependency, streaming, ZIP64, `open_for_update`, `repack`), **validators** in Python, C++ and JavaScript with the same stable finding codes; C++ and JavaScript check the schema with the checker generated from it (`scripts/gen_kinds.py`), so the three validators agree on the conformance corpus.
- ✅ Sketch documents (2026-10-14): chemical identity on `structure` sections, `reaction.scheme`, `preview` with the member field `media_type`, job sets (`run.record` `job_ref`), one media type and macOS UTI for `.qvf`, `x_vibesketch` registered, and the withdrawn `qvf_version` 2 read as a warning.
- ✅ Family data (2026-10-15, toolkit 0.3.0): `localization_reference_basis` and three deprecated `mo_metadata` keys, `null` for a `job.spec` `functional` or `basis`, the viewer hints `energy_window`, `camera` and `crossfade`, `structure_ref` on standalone `bonds` sections, and one rule for the withdrawn `qvf_version` 2; qvf is the single source of the format for the family.
- ✅ **Conformance suite**: current main has 78 golden archives (canonical kinds, edge cases and compatibility), 118 must-fail archives and one legacy archive; toolkit 0.6.0 has 75 / 110 / 1. Python, C++ and JavaScript runners share the corpus. The additional main cases are Unreleased.
- ✅ Typed `Manifest` / `Section` / `MemberSpec` model in C++ and Python, generated kind and unit tables, single-header amalgamation, and `@qvf/core` reader. The complete C ABI covers every canonical kind and preserves all legacy symbols.
- ✅ Governance: every contract change has a dated record in `GOVERNANCE.md` and a `registry.json` promotion; nothing bumped `qvf_version`.

## Release boundary and current main

For the frozen QC 0.18 / Sketch 0.6 / View 3.0 / Queue 1.0 interfaces,
prioritize demonstrated interoperability blockers and preserve their QVF
v0.6.0 pins, accepted source/artifact hashes and geometry identities. The
[family workflow](docs/family_workflow.md#correlated-results-and-campaign-acceptance)
distinguishes reference and correlated results and the consumer limits.
Broader format and toolkit development follows in compatible releases; it
does not expand the scope of these frozen releases.

The latest tagged toolkit is **0.6.0** (2026-10-22), implementing **QVF v1**.
It passed the six candidate CI checks and installed Python/C/C++ acceptance.
GitHub publication is verified against the qualified source inventory, and
vibe-qc, vibe-view, vibe-sketch and vibe-queue pin this toolkit on main.
These source pins do not claim that every packaged consumer has been rebuilt.
A toolkit version increment does not require a new archive format, and the
v2 ledger below is not a release gate for additive toolkit work.

Toolkit 0.6.0 adds static XSF and geometry-only PDB conversion, a local Conan recipe
with installed C/C++ consumer checks, and `qvf prepare-job` / `qvf.jobs.prepare_job`.
The latter preserves drawing and geometry data while creating an explicit
pending single-job request; the [family workflow](docs/family_workflow.md)
includes an executable Sketch example. These additions are included in **0.6.0**;
they do not imply registry publication, full biomolecular PDB conversion or
multi-species reaction scheduling. See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and the
individual work packages for supported boundaries. Current main additionally
contains the following **Unreleased** work:

| Landed work | Compatibility and adoption boundary |
|---|---|
| Bounded molecular Molden conversion (WP-48) | Independently checked against PySCF; uses existing v1 structure/wavefunction members. |
| Typed biomolecular atom-site identity (#18) | Optional insertion code, alternate location, occupancy and hetero fields. The PDB converter now maps them (#27, Unreleased). Consumers adopt the fields after pinning a release containing them. |
| Canonical reaction-step energies (#16) | Typed terms, method and run provenance, with shared validator checks. Frozen Sketch keeps `x_vibesketch.energies`; the canonical field requires a later release pin. |
| Kind catalogue, documentation site and Python, C++ and C API references (WP-64, #19–#22) | Source and local build support landed; site publication remains separate work. |

The dated [governance records](GOVERNANCE.md#version-history-and-decisions)
define the two additive contract changes. Format version 1 does not imply
that an older toolkit accepts every later optional field. Keep the frozen
family on the v0.6.0 schema and [check packaged runtime pins as well as source
pins](docs/family_workflow.md#check-the-packaged-qvf-runtime).

## Milestones and weekly reconciliation

The canonical GitHub project tracks **Next toolkit - adoption readiness** and
**Ecosystem adoption - Phase 4** as development milestones. The first groups
the landed converters, drawing-preserving job preparation and installed
consumer/packaging work for the next bounded release. The second tracks
selection and acceptance of independent consumers and language bindings.
Their acceptance issues link the existing work packages rather than replacing
the briefs. Toolkit 0.6.0 completed source qualification, publication and family
source-pin acceptance. The next toolkit version and date remain unselected.
These milestones do not schedule a breaking archive format or require all ecosystem proposals for
an additive release.

Every week compare this roadmap and its linked work packages/design records
with main, tags, release notes, issue state and conformance/consumer evidence.
Correct stale status, distinguish implementation from validation and release,
and preserve explicitly deferred work. Once a bounded milestone's acceptance
passes, mark the release target ready and select/advance the next toolkit
version under the normal release process. Package versions and tags still
require candidate checks; archive-format changes follow [governance](GOVERNANCE.md).
Neither a paper deadline nor toolkit milestones automatically increments the
archive format. The v2 ledger remains unscheduled.

## Guiding goals

1. **No vendor section for mainstream data.** A code that computes energies, gradients, Hessians, orbitals (with ECPs), densities, excited states, spectra, bands, phonons, or MD should find a canonical kind for all of it.
2. **Contract, not convention.** Every member payload has a schema; every unit has a name; every reference resolves; the validator proves it.
3. **One library, every language.** Streaming, ZIP64, in-place update, complete C ABI, Fortran, Python, JS reader, Rust crate — all certified by one corpus.
4. **Still v1.** Everything above is additive. Breaking ideas go to the v2 ledger and wait.

## Phase 0 — hygiene and defects (implementation complete except hosting)

Small, independent, mostly mechanical. Clears the ground so later packages do not fight stale references.

- ✅ **WP-01** CHANGELOG, frozen legacy v2 schema, dangling references (D10)
- ✅ **WP-02** Schema description scrub, section-number sync (D01)
- ✅ **WP-03** Portable pi, GitHub Actions matrix incl. MSVC, sanitizers (D14)
- ✅ **WP-04** Writer/schema mismatches: phonon members, `atom_properties` roles, DOS peer fields (D02, D03, D08)
- ✅ **WP-05** Validator hardening + negative corpus + stable finding codes (D15, D17)
- ⬜ **WP-06** Schema `$id` domain and hosting (D09) — current `$id` retained by 2026-10-15 decision; hosting pending
- ✅ **WP-07** Deprecate `provenance.hostname`; sanitisation guidance (D11)

## Phase 1 — contract completeness (done)

Turns prose into schema. The largest single step toward "a standard external codes can adopt". Opus-grade work; three batches that can run in parallel.

- ✅ **WP-10** Payload schemas A: grid, basis, mo_metadata, trajectory family, vibrations (P01)
- ✅ **WP-11** Payload schemas B: spectra (typed NMR/EPR, peaks, broadening), bonds, bond orders, SCF history, QTAIM with unit, symmetry (P01, P13, D05, D18)
- ✅ **WP-12** Payload schemas C: kpath, DOS meta, Fermi mesh, qpath, phonon meta, EOS fit, run-record files; spin axis on projections; `bands.occupations` (P01, P14, D04)
- ✅ **WP-13** Units vocabulary and self-describing `units` objects (P02, D12)
- ✅ **WP-14** Corpus v2: one archive per kind, edge cases, ZIP64 and descriptor archives, C++ runner
- ✅ **WP-15** Lattice conventions documented + `Lattice` helper (D06)

## Phase 2 — format expansion (additive under v1; done, demand-driven items open)

Each item is spec + schema + registry + both writers + validator + corpus + docs + decision record. Ordered by how often the data appears in practice.

- ✅ **WP-20** Root `metadata` (FAIR) and generic `structure_ref` / `run_ref` / `group` (P03, P04)
- ✅ **WP-21** `energies` root block, `forces`, `hessian` kinds (P05–P07)
- ✅ **WP-22** `excited_states` kind, NTOs, `volume.transition_density` (P08)
- ✅ **WP-23** Wavefunction: ECP, overlap, density matrix, two-component, labels; normalization becomes checkable (P09)
- ✅ **WP-24** `atom_properties`: more schemes, vector roles, `custom.<name>` (P10)
- ✅ **WP-25** Volumes: vector, complex, series, Laplacian; periodic grid endpoint rule (P11)
- ✅ **WP-26** Trajectories: cell, velocities, forces, times, float32 MD (P12)
- ✅ **WP-27** Provenance and job-spec tightening (P18)
- ✅ **WP-28** Container rules: member `size`, orphans, in-place update semantics, `byte_order` (P19, P20)
- ✅ **WP-29** Periodic extras: Fermi mesh shifts, electric/elastic/dielectric properties, magnetic moments (P14, P17)
- ✅ **WP-30** `wavefunction.bloch` provisional canonical (P15) — promoted provisionally
- ✅ **Unreleased, #16:** canonical reaction-step energies with signed participant
  terms, absolute values, method/run provenance and consistent thermal conditions.
  Shared validators check the terms and sums; atom/charge balance and source
  freshness remain producer obligations. Frozen consumers retain the vendor
  extension until adopting a release that contains this contract.
- ✅ **Unreleased, #18:** typed biomolecular atom-site identity preserves insertion
  codes, alternate locations and occupancies; converter and consumer adoption
  remain separate from the format definition.
- ⬜ Demand-driven, not scheduled: `wavefunction.nao` / `.sto` (P16), `spectra.xas` / `.mossbauer` (P13)

## Phase 3 — libqvf (core and C++/C/Python facades landed)

The library other codes link. Core first, then the facades, then every binding over them.

- ✅ **WP-40** Container core: ZIP64, streaming write, append mode, limits, fuzz target (D13, D19)
- ✅ **WP-41** Typed model + schema-driven codegen (kind tables, generated payload checker, unit enum)
- ✅ **WP-42** C++ `Writer`, chunked `TensorView`, all canonical typed kinds and `Editor` (append, optional atomic commit, streaming repack)
- ✅ **WP-43** C++ lazy `Reader`, typed manifest/tensor access, streaming, `get<K>` protocol and staged validation with shared finding codes; canonical kind decoders are supplied by WP-42
- ✅ **WP-44** Complete C ABI: writer for every kind, reader, validator, editor; shared-library export; ABI versioning (D16)
- 🔨 **WP-45** Fortran module over the complete C ABI and checked writers landed; Linux GNU 12 candidate and focused GNU 16/Python interoperability checks pass; other compiler/platform coverage remains
- ✅ **WP-46** Python `qvf` package: model, streaming writer, lazy typed reader, editor, shims (D20)
- ✅ **WP-47** CLI `qvf`: staged validate, info, cat, extract, numeric diff, repack, reported scrub, conformance, schema
- 🔨 **WP-48** Converters: scalar cube and geometry-only XYZ/extXYZ with trajectories are in 0.5.0 ([guide](docs/converters.md)); static XSF primitive geometry/scalar grids and single-model PDB geometry are included in 0.6.0. Bounded real molecular s/p/sp/d Molden conversion is on main (Unreleased), with independent orbital-value checks. PDB import/export of atom-site identity, alternate locations and model ensembles is on main (Unreleased, #27), with independent gemmi and RDKit read-back checks. PDB `HELIX`/`SHEET` ranges map to typed `secondary_structure` (#28) and `CONECT` to structure bonds (#29) and `CRYST1`/`SCALE` to a periodic cell with its space group (#30), `SSBOND`/`LINK` to structure bonds (#31), `REMARK 350` assemblies to expanded structures (#32), and opt-in crystal symmetry expansion to the unit cell (#33), all Unreleased. Core crystal CIF import (unit cell from the space group) and P 1 export (#34), VASP POSCAR/CONTCAR (#35) and CHGCAR (#36) and mmCIF (#37) import/export and opt-in PDB NCS copy generation (#38) are on main (Unreleased). extXYZ energy/forces/stress (#39) XSF forces/several grids (#40) and Molden f/g shells (#41) are on main (Unreleased).
- 🔨 **WP-49** Packaging: CMake library-only options and pkg-config metadata landed; a local Conan 2 recipe, installed C/C++ consumers and release/adoption checklist are included in 0.6.0. PyPI trusted publishing, vcpkg and registry distribution remain.
- ⬜ **WP-50** Fuzzing in CI, big-endian QEMU job

## Phase 4 — ecosystem

- ✅ **WP-60** JavaScript/TypeScript reader (`@qvf/core`) — enables web viewers and notebooks
- ⬜ **WP-61** Rust crate — independent implementation certified by the corpus
- 🔨 **WP-62** PySCF adapter — molecular SCF/DFT (#23), explicit spherical signs (#24), closed-shell TDA/TDHF/TDDFT states, spectra and singlet-TDA NTOs (#25), singlet full-response NTOs retaining X+Y and non-unit weights (#26), and closed-shell triplet NTOs as α/β spin-orbital channels are on main (Unreleased), with optional adapter coverage in candidate CI ([guide](docs/adapters/pyscf.md)). Unrestricted response, grid densities, periodic Γ-point calculations and ECP projectors remain.
- ⬜ **WP-63** vibe-qc links libqvf instead of carrying its own implementation (maintainer note; after WP-42/43/46 stabilise; not high priority)
- 🔨 **WP-64** Docs site with generated API reference and kind catalogue: the generated kind catalogue (`docs/kinds.md`, checked by `gen_kinds.py --check`) the mkdocs site configuration (`mkdocs.yml`, strict local build) the mkdocstrings Python API reference and the Doxygen C++/C API reference landed; publishing remains
- ⬜ **WP-65** Julia binding (demand-driven)
- ⬜ Governance: as independent producers ship, the steering model broadens per `GOVERNANCE.md` § "Evolving the governance"

## Phase 5 — v2 (collect, do not schedule)

`docs/format_review.md` § 4 keeps the ledger: byte order in dtype names, chunked
members and alternative compression, dtype expansion, one length unit, one
lattice convention, spectrum axis rename, required structure refs, manifest
self-hash. A v2 is cut only when the ledger is worth a breaking release for
every consumer, and never for an optional field.

## Decisions the maintainer owns before the affected packages start

1. Canonical schema domain (WP-06) — decided 2026-10-15: retain the current `$id`; hosting pending.
2. QTAIM position unit (WP-11) — decided: ångström, provisional.
3. Closed `Section` branches once peer fields are named (WP-04) — done.
4. Python distribution name after restructuring (WP-46) — decided 2026-10-15: keep `qvf-writer` and the `qvf_writer` / `qvf_reader` imports.
5. Provisional promotion of `wavefunction.bloch` (WP-30) — decided: promoted, provisional.
6. Whether validators accept the withdrawn `qvf_version` 2 — decided 2026-10-14: read as 1, warning `W_VERSION_WITHDRAWN`.
7. Registering `application/vnd.vibe-qc.qvf+zip` with IANA — decided 2026-10-15: prepare a [draft for maintainer review](docs/iana-media-type-registration.md); submission is not authorized and the media type remains unregistered.

The implementation chats also recorded smaller readings in their
`GOVERNANCE.md` entries (for example the Buckingham quadrupole convention, the
periodic-grid span rule, the Bloch-sum phase, and that writers stamp
`metadata.uuid` / `created_utc` by default); each is open to revision before
the next release.

## Remaining work (reviewed 2026-10-24)

The 2026-10-10 pause has ended. The remaining work is:

- Toolkit 0.6.0 is published and pinned on all four family main branches.
  Reuse the accepted drawing-to-job round trip and installed-consumer evidence.
  Current main's Molden subset, two additive contract changes and documentation
  tranches await a later compatible release and explicit consumer adoption.
  The frozen releases take priority; no new version or release date is selected.
- After the frozen releases, Phase 3 continues with WP-45 / WP-48, then packaging and broader platform checks. WP-46 supplies the Python `qvf` package while keeping `qvf_writer`, `qvf_reader`, `qvf_kinds`, `qvf_model` and `qvf_units` as compatibility imports. `pip install <checkout>/python` preserves those imports for consumers such as vibe-sketch.
- Parked: WP-06 (hosting the retained schema `$id`), WP-61 (needs a Rust toolchain in CI), compound unit names such as hartree/bohr in the § 4.3 vocabulary, a CI job that runs the C++ / JavaScript / Python schema-checker parity test (it needs all three toolchains in one job), and a coverage-guided fuzzing run on Linux (WP-50).
- Known consumer gap: no consumer renders `wavefunction.bloch` yet. The cc-pV6Z `l = 6` channel-export defect is fixed on vibe-qc main (#546); existing consumer releases may still need that fix. Fresh checks did not reproduce `space_group_number: 0`: absent symmetry is omitted and a genuine group 221 passes.

## Getting involved

If you write a quantum-chemistry code and want to emit QVF, see the
[integration guide](docs/integration_guide.md). Missing a kind or a field is
a conversation, not a dead end: open an issue naming the data, and it enters
Phase 2 with a proposal id.
