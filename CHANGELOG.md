# Changelog

All notable changes to the QVF format and to this toolkit are recorded here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Decisions that affect the on-disk contract are argued in full in
[`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md); this file is the short, dated index of them.
The toolkit version is in [`VERSION`](VERSION) and the format version
(`qvf_version`) is described in the governance versioning policy.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Prepare Python distribution `qvf-writer` 0.7.0rc1 for its first PyPI
  publication, with SPDX license metadata, a runnable PySCF tutorial and
  an opt-in Trusted Publishing workflow. This Python-only candidate does
  not retag toolkit v0.6.0 or change frozen consumer pins.


- Improve the documentation entry points with a getting-started guide,
  tagged-source installation, executable create/read/validate/job examples
  and explicit released-versus-development support. Fix API specification
  links, distinguish sections from their members, correct AO-axis guidance,
  and reconcile already decided distribution/domain choices. No format or
  validation behavior change.

- Install PySCF 2.14.0 in the existing Python 3.13/3.14 candidate CI jobs so
  the optional adapter tests run, with OpenMP and BLAS limited to one thread.
  Keep the Python 3.9 job without PySCF and document source installation of
  the unreleased adapter. No new CI job or change to CI triggers.

- Clarify the existing spherical AO sign convention in Appendix A.2 (#24):
  phase-free real solid harmonics, a general formula and the five `d`
  polynomials. Document why the overlap diagonal cannot detect component
  sign flips. No archive, schema, registry or validation behavior change.

- Document how to select the producer-pinned validator and record toolkit,
  source and schema identity. Clarify that format version 1 and the schema
  identifier do not select a toolkit release, and preserve valid null job
  fields and original archives when an older validator rejects them.
  Documentation only; no format or validation behavior change.

- Reconcile the roadmap with the landed, unreleased reaction-energy and
  biomolecular contracts, current corpus counts and documentation tranches.
  Document packaged QVF version/hash and save/reopen checks alongside source
  pins, following the Sketch Linux runtime mismatch. Frozen consumers remain
  on toolkit v0.6.0; no format, dependency or runtime change.

- Document the frozen family interfaces' QVF v0.6.0 compatibility boundary:
  distinguish SCF reference provenance from correlated structured results,
  preserve campaign/source/geometry hashes and raw verdicts, and state the
  separate Sketch campaign, View inspection and Queue transport limits.
  No archive, schema, implementation or dependency change.

### Added

- WP-48 (#41): Molden f and g shells, spherical and Cartesian, in both
  directions, with the `[5D]`, `[5D7F]`, `[5D10F]`, `[7F]`, `[9G]` and `[15G]`
  conventions. Component order and Cartesian scaling are converted to QVF
  Appendix A. PySCF-written f/g files give the same orbital values after
  import and export. No format change.
- WP-48 (#40): XSF forces, several datagrids and conventional-cell records.
  Atom rows may carry forces (hartree/Å), which become a `forces` section
  and are exported back. Every `DATAGRID_3D` in every block becomes its own
  labelled volume section, and `CONVVEC`/`CONVCOORD` are accepted and
  reported. ASE reads the exported forces with the same values. No format
  change.
- WP-48 (#39): extXYZ energy, forces and stress. `Properties` is parsed
  generically. `energy`, `forces:R:3` and `stress` become the root energy or
  trajectory energies, the gradient (a `forces` section or the trajectory
  `gradient`) and the stress, in atomic units. `Z` is checked against the
  species, and other header keys and columns are reported instead of
  refused. extXYZ export writes them back in eV units, and ASE reads them
  with the same values. No format change.
- WP-48 (#38): opt-in generation of PDB `MTRIX` copies that the file does
  not give (`import_pdb(..., expand_ncs=True)`, `qvf convert --expand-ncs`).
  The deposited atoms and the copies form an `asymmetric_unit` section,
  with chains named `<chain>-<serial>`. `REMARK 350` assemblies and the
  unit-cell expansion are then built from it instead of being blocked. The
  copies agree with gemmi's `expand_ncs`. No format change.
- WP-48 (#37): mmCIF (PDBx) import and atom-site export (`import_mmcif`,
  `export_mmcif`, `qvf convert --from mmcif` / `--to mmcif`, `--block`).
  `_atom_site` rows keep the PDB atom-site identity, preferring the author
  columns. Models, the cell and space group, helices and sheet strands, and
  `_struct_conn` bonds follow the PDB import. Export writes an `_atom_site`
  loop, plus `_cell` when periodic, without the PDB column limits. A
  gemmi-written mmCIF imports like the PDB file it came from, and gemmi reads
  the export. No format change.
- WP-48 (#36): VASP CHGCAR-family import and export (`import_chgcar`,
  `export_chgcar`, `qvf convert --from chgcar` / `--to chgcar`). The POSCAR
  head becomes the periodic structure. The first grid becomes
  `volume.density` in e/bohr³ on a periodic grid without the endpoint. A
  collinear magnetization becomes `volume.spin` and a noncollinear one
  `volume.vector`. PAW augmentation lines are skipped and counted, and the
  report gives the integrated electron count. Export writes the density and
  one magnetization on the same grid, without augmentation. ASE reads the
  export and ASE-written files import to the same grid. No format change.
- WP-48 (#35): VASP POSCAR/CONTCAR import and export (`import_poscar`,
  `export_poscar`, `qvf convert --from poscar` / `--to poscar`, `--species`).
  Import handles the scale (factor, volume or per-axis), VASP 5 species
  lines (POTCAR labels reduced to the element) and, with an explicit species
  list, VASP 4 files. Direct and Cartesian positions are read. Atoms fixed on
  all three axes become `constraints.frozen_atoms`; partial flags and CONTCAR
  velocities are reported, not stored. Export writes Direct coordinates in
  archive order with one species entry per element run, and Selective
  dynamics from `frozen_atoms`. ASE reads the export back. No format change.
- WP-48 (#34): core crystallographic CIF import and P 1 CIF export
  (`import_cif`, `export_cif`, `qvf convert --from cif` / `--to cif`,
  `--block`). One data block's fractional sites are expanded to the whole
  unit cell with the listed symmetry operations, or the Hall symbol, and
  special-position copies are merged. The result is a periodic structure in
  the standard orientation with a `structure.symmetry` section. Elements come
  only from `_atom_site_type_symbol`. Labels, occupancy and isotropic
  displacement are kept. The Hall-symbol parser matches gemmi for all 564
  settings, and the unit cells match gemmi's. No new dependency and no
  format change.
- WP-48 (#33): opt-in PDB crystal symmetry expansion
  (`import_pdb(..., expand_symmetry=True)`, `qvf convert --expand-symmetry`)
  adds a periodic `unit_cell` structure with every space-group copy of the
  first model, each shifted so its centre lies in the cell, and a `P 1`
  symmetry section. Operators come from a built-in Hall-symbol parser for
  the 65 chiral space groups under their wwPDB names and common settings,
  each checked against gemmi; copies are named `<chain>-<n>`, and atoms on
  symmetry elements are merged and counted. No new dependency and no
  format change.
- WP-48 (#32): each PDB `REMARK 350` biomolecule becomes its own
  nonperiodic structure section `assembly_<n>`, with the `BIOMT` operators
  applied to its chains. Copies under an identity operator keep their chain;
  other copies are named `<chain>-<serial>`. Identity, bonds within each copy
  and secondary-structure ranges are copied, and the deposited structure is
  unchanged. `MTRIX` records are counted; when an NCS copy is not given, no
  assembly is built and the report says why. Operators must be proper
  rotations. Coordinates agree with gemmi's `make_assembly`. No format
  change.
- WP-48 (#31): PDB `SSBOND` and `LINK` records become structure bonds,
  merged with the `CONECT` pairs without an order. Atoms resolve by
  atom-site identity, following alternate locations; a missing, ambiguous or
  self-bonded atom refuses the import, and records to a symmetry mate are
  skipped and counted. Export with atom-site identity writes `SSBOND` for
  cysteine SG-SG bonds and `LINK` for other inter-residue bonds involving a
  hetero atom, alongside `CONECT`. gemmi reads them back as connections, and
  gemmi-written records import to the same bonds. No format change.
- WP-48 (#30): a PDB `CRYST1` cell becomes a periodic structure in the
  PDB standard orientation, with a `structure.symmetry` section recording the
  space group; symmetry mates are not generated, and the report gives Z. The
  wwPDB placeholder cell means no cell. `SCALE1`-`SCALE3` must match the
  standard orthogonalization, or the import is refused. Export writes `CRYST1`
  and `SCALE` for a fully periodic structure whose lattice is in PDB
  orientation, and refuses rotated lattices and partial periodicity instead
  of rotating coordinates. gemmi reads the exported cell back. No format
  change.
- WP-48 (#29): PDB `CONECT` records become the structure section's own
  `bonds` member. Each distinct atom pair is one bond with no inferred order;
  repeated listings are counted, not read as bond orders. A dangling serial or
  self-bond refuses the import, and ensembles resolve serials per model.
  Export writes `CONECT` for every bond assigned to the structure (its member
  or a `bonds` section, spec § 5.1), from both atoms, and counts the orders it
  cannot write. RDKit reads the exported bonds back. No format change.
- #28: typed secondary-structure range ends and classes. Additive under v1:
  `$defs/BiomoleculeSecondaryStructure` gains optional
  `start_insertion_code` / `end_insertion_code`, `helix_class` (PDB 1-10,
  `helix` ranges only) and `sheet_id` / `strand` (`sheet` ranges only). Spec
  § 5.1 (*Secondary-structure ranges*) makes range ends residues by the
  (chain, seq, insertion code) key, and lets a range name an end that the
  structure lacks. New corpus vectors: `structure_secondary_structure`
  (must pass) and `structure_helix_class_on_sheet` (schema-only `E_SCHEMA`).
  The PDB converter maps `HELIX`/`SHEET` records to these ranges on import
  and back on export with atom-site identity, counts unresolved ends and
  omitted `coil` ranges, and is checked against gemmi. See GOVERNANCE.md.
- WP-48 (#27): PDB conversion keeps the atom-site identity of spec § 5.1.
  Import records each atom's name, residue name and number, chain, insertion
  code, alternate location, occupancy, temperature factor and
  `ATOM`/`HETATM`, and lists the section's `chains` and `residues` keyed by
  (chain, number, insertion code). Alternate locations are kept as separate
  atoms instead of being refused, and nothing is selected by occupancy. A
  multi-model ensemble becomes model 1 plus a `trajectory` when its models
  share atoms and metadata, and one `structure` per model otherwise. Export
  writes that identity back when every atom has a name, residue name and
  number, and refuses values that do not fit the columns. Structures without
  it keep the synthetic `UNL` records. gemmi and RDKit read the exported
  files back in the optional tests. No schema, registry or validator change.
- WP-62 tranche 3 (#26): paired singlet TDHF/TDDFT NTOs, including Casida
  response, from PySCF's `sqrt(2)(X+Y)` charge-transition matrix. Preserve
  squared singular-value weights without unit normalization and source
  amplitudes without mutation; the stored pairs reconstruct length-gauge
  transition moments. Existing singlet-TDA behavior is unchanged. Triplet
  NTOs and unrestricted/open-shell response remain unsupported. Uses the
  existing NTO contract; no schema, registry or validator change.

- WP-62 tranche 2 (#25): `qvf.adapters.pyscf.add_td` / `write_td` export
  closed-shell RHF/RKS TDA, TDHF and TDDFT state tables and length-gauge
  UV-visible sticks, preserving the SCF reference, source root order and
  frozen MO indices. Singlet TDA adds canonical paired NTOs without mutating
  source amplitudes. Unsupported references, unconverged roots and malformed
  amplitudes are refused; tranche 3 above extends NTOs to singlet full response.
  Uses existing format kinds and fields; no schema or registry change.

- WP-62 tranche 1 (#23): the PySCF adapter `qvf.adapters.pyscf`, a second
  independent producer of `wavefunction.gto`, with the optional extra
  `qvf-writer[pyscf]` (PySCF 2.14 or later). `write_scf(mf, path)` writes a
  molecular RHF, UHF, ROHF, RKS, UKS or ROKS result as `structure`,
  `wavefunction.gto` (spherical or Cartesian basis on `N_i`-normalized
  primitives, Appendix A.2 in-shell order, the AO `overlap` and density
  matrices), `atom_properties` (Mulliken and Löwdin charges, Mulliken spin
  populations), `job.spec` (`functional` null for Hartree–Fock) and the
  `provenance` and `energies` blocks; `add_scf` and single-section helpers
  add to an open writer. PySCF is imported lazily. The spherical map is solved
  from PySCF's `cart2sph` tables against the spec's real solid harmonics,
  not assumed. Tests (skipped without PySCF) compare every orbital with an
  evaluator written from Appendix A; `scripts/pyscf_cross_producer.py`
  compares an archive with a PySCF rebuild. Guide: `docs/adapters/pyscf.md`.
  No format, schema or registry change.
- WP-64 tranche 4 (#22): a generated C++ and C API reference in the
  documentation site. `cpp/Doxyfile` covers the public headers in
  `cpp/include/qvf/`, including the C ABI 1 header. `mkdocs build` runs
  Doxygen through `scripts/mkdocs_hooks.py` and publishes the HTML under
  `api/cpp-reference/`, linked from `docs/api/cpp.md`, and a Doxygen warning
  fails `--strict`. The input filter `scripts/doxygen_filter.py` gives the
  headers' existing plain comments to Doxygen as documentation without
  changing any header or the single header. `QVF_DOCS_NO_DOXYGEN=1` builds
  the site without Doxygen. No library or format change.
- WP-64 tranche 3 (#21): a generated Python API reference,
  `docs/api/python.md`, in the documentation site. mkdocstrings renders the
  docstrings of the writer, reader, kinds, editor, model, validate, units,
  convert, jobs, operations and conformance modules and of the compatibility
  `QvfWriter` by static analysis, without importing the package. The
  toolchain pins `mkdocstrings` and `mkdocstrings-python` in
  `scripts/requirements-docs.txt`. A literal `[i][j]` in the spec's
  `born_charges` row and the conformance runner's usage lines are now code,
  so strict builds resolve every reference. No format or behavior change.
- WP-64 tranche 2 (#20): `mkdocs.yml` builds a static documentation site
  from `docs/`, the kind catalogue and the top-level documents (spec,
  governance, changelog, roadmap, contributing, security, conformance) with
  `mkdocs build --strict`. `scripts/mkdocs_hooks.py` keeps every document's
  repository-relative links: a link to a site page stays on the site, and a
  link to another repository file points at the public source tree. Headings
  get GitHub-style anchors. The toolchain is pinned in
  `scripts/requirements-docs.txt`. CI does not build or publish the site.
- WP-64 tranche 1 (#19): a generated kind catalogue, `docs/kinds.md`. For
  every canonical kind in registry order it lists the member roles (format,
  dtypes, rank, payload definition), section fields, payload fields, nested
  object definitions and fixed units, with an abbreviated example from the
  must-pass conformance corpus. `scripts/gen_kinds.py` renders it through
  `scripts/gen_kind_docs.py`, and `--check` fails when it is stale.
  Documentation only: no schema, registry, validator or format-version change.
- WP-48: bounded molecular Molden import/export in `qvf.convert` and the CLI.
  Real s/p/sp and spherical/Cartesian d orbitals map to existing QVF v1
  structure and wavefunction members with explicit spin selection,
  normalization/order conversion and loss reports. Unsupported dialects,
  ECPs, periodic/complex orbitals and higher angular momenta are refused.
  Independent PySCF comparisons check orbital values in both directions.
  No schema, registry, validator finding or format-version change.
- #18: optional typed per-atom `insertion_code`, `alt_loc`, `occupancy` and
  `hetero` on `$defs/StructureAtom`, and `insertion_code` on
  `$defs/BiomoleculeResidue`, with the residue/conformer/model identity rules
  of spec § 5.1 (*Biomolecular atom identity*). Residues 10 and 10A stay
  distinct; alternate locations keep their occupancy. Additive under v1:
  generated C++/JS/Python tables and C++ typed records regenerated, the Python
  writer passes the fields through and refuses a residue whose insertion code
  disagrees with its atoms. New corpus archive `structure_biomolecule` and
  negative `structure_occupancy_range`.
- #16: `reaction.scheme` step `energies` (`$defs/ReactionStepEnergies`,
  version 1): energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy deltas in hartree with
  optional kcal/mol, thermal conditions, and one term per participant with its
  signed coefficient, absolute values, method and source run (`run_ref` or a
  parsed output `source`). Python, C++ and JavaScript validators check the
  terms against the participants, the sums, the conversion, one method, no
  resonance energies and `run_ref` (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`, `E_REF_UNRESOLVED`).
  The Python writer checks the same rules; the C++ writer passes the object
  through. Additive under v1. New corpus archive `reaction_scheme_energies`
  and six negatives.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-22

This additive toolkit release keeps QVF v1, the normative schema, registry,
validator findings and C ABI unchanged. Existing Python imports remain available.
XSF/PDB converters support only the documented subsets; Conan packaging is local,
with no package-index publication.

### Changed

- Reconcile roadmap and work-package status with toolkit 0.5.0 and current
  main: retain the schema identifier with hosting still open, distinguish
  unreleased converters, packaging and pending-job workflows, and separate
  historical design proposals from current implementation.

### Added

- WP-48: geometry-only PDB import/export through `qvf.convert` and the CLI.
  Imports require explicit element columns and refuse alternate locations
  and multi-model ensembles. Reports identify discarded biomolecular/crystal
  metadata and export precision; synthetic export records make no identity
  or connectivity claim. No schema, registry or format change.

- Executable one-species Sketch drawing example for the Unreleased
  `prepare-job` workflow. The family guide distinguishes preserved drawing
  data, the canonical job request, read-only checks and Queue submission.

- `qvf.jobs.prepare_job` and `qvf prepare-job` turn one geometry/document
  archive into an explicit pending single-job request while preserving its
  structure, bonds, preview and vendor bytes. Source and output receive full
  validation; ambiguous, calculated or incompatible inputs are refused, and
  publication uses a new path atomically. Optional basis/functional retain
  absent versus null semantics. No NumPy dependency or format/schema change.

- WP-49: local Conan 2 C/C++ recipe with static/shared options, exact committed
  source export, installed CMake/pkg-config metadata and Apache notices.
  Small installed C99/C++17 consumers exercise package use. A portable
  release/adoption checklist distinguishes source checks, candidate acceptance
  and publication; no package-registry upload is added.

- WP-48: static XSF primitive geometry and scalar-grid import/export through
  `qvf.convert` and `qvf convert`. Coordinates convert explicitly, sample
  ordering and endpoint planes are preserved, and field periodicity is
  supplied separately from structural periodicity. Unsupported records and
  missing periodic endpoints fail without publishing output. No format or
  schema changes.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-16

The toolkit APIs below are additive. Archives remain QVF v1, the normative
schema is unchanged, and legacy Python imports and C/C++ entry points remain
available. The Python array APIs now require the optional `numpy` extra;
install `qvf-writer[numpy,validate]` for those APIs and full schema validation.

### Fixed

- Typed vector, array and map decoders use explicit loop bodies, avoiding
  GCC misleading-indentation warnings when building with warnings as errors.
  The generated single header carries the same correction.

- Source archives suppress Python bytecode during staged generated-file checks,
  keeping the tar/ZIP inventory byte-identical to committed source even when
  checking generators that import other local modules.

### Added

- Candidate CI explicitly installs the optional NumPy extra for array tests,
  checks generated Fortran bindings, and exercises the Fortran writer/layout
  checks in the existing Linux GCC job with runtime bounds checking.

- WP-45 source slice: optional `qvf::fortran` modules, generated bindings for
  every C ABI entry point, and checked structure, scalar-volume, trajectory
  and restricted-GTO writers. Wrappers convert Fortran array layout explicitly;
  focused gfortran/Python checks cover layout, ownership and refusal behavior.
  Installed modules and sources support CMake consumers.

- WP-49 packaging slice: relocatable `qvf.pc` metadata and independent CMake
  test/example switches. Embedded consumers build only the library by default;
  standalone builds retain tests and examples. Installed CMake targets
  propagate C++17 and shared builds expose the C API import definition.

- WP-48 first slice: standard-library-only `qvf.convert` and `qvf convert`
  for scalar cube and geometry-only XYZ/extXYZ, including trajectories and
  variable cells. Converters validate new QVF files, preserve grid ordering
  and explicit periodic endpoint semantics, report losses, refuse unsupported
  fields and publish only completed outputs at a new path.

- Register the advisory `x_ascent` namespace for non-critical ASCENT dataset
  exchange beside canonical structures (#13). No format or validator change.

- WP-44: complete additive C ABI 1 for streaming writers, every canonical
  kind, periodic structures, lazy readers, staged validation and optional
  atomic editing. The original C signatures remain available. Shared builds
  export the API and install with ABI-versioned library names. C examples
  round-trip every canonical kind and are checked by the Python validator.
  Legacy wavefunction overlap/ECP setters can reread streamed metadata.

- A portable pending-job example and family workflow guide covering queue
  submission, viewer inspection and sketch geometry conversion. The guide
  distinguishes consumer capabilities from format conformance and preserves
  the original archive during conversions. File-identification prose now
  states that the QVF media type is proposed and its registration awaits
  submission approval; identifiers are unchanged.

- WP-47: `qvf` / `python -m qvf` commands for staged validation, archive info,
  JSON display, verified member extraction, numeric diff, repack, reported
  scrubbing to a new archive, conformance and schema output. Existing
  `qvf-validate` behavior is retained. Python validation stages match the C++
  facade boundaries and preserve the full validator's finding codes. The
  shared installed/script corpus runner no longer requires NumPy.

- WP-46: the Python `qvf` package, retaining the `qvf-writer` distribution
  name. Streaming `Writer` member sinks support raw buffers, endian
  conversion and ZIP64; lazy typed `Reader` supports NumPy-free memoryviews;
  `Editor` appends, commits atomically on request and repacks. The package
  includes the model, units, generated tables and schema. The original
  `qvf_writer` / `qvf_reader` modules remain compatible, with deprecation
  warnings, and the existing validator finding codes are unchanged.

- C++ streaming `Writer`, optional atomic `Editor`, and borrowed `TensorView`
  conversion in bounded chunks, preserving the existing `QvfWriter` API.
  File, memory and callback sinks share the same backend; updates, run status
  and streaming repack use the established archive lifecycle (WP-42).
- Schema-generated concrete records and named roles for all 56 canonical
  kinds, with `Writer::add` / `Reader::get<K>` and lossless extension fields.
  Owning decoded tensors and borrowed producer views share `TensorData`.
  Typed writes check schema and sizes before writing; late conversion
  failures remove the new section and its directory entries.
- C++ `qvf::Reader` with a lossless typed manifest, lazy JSON/tensor/opaque
  member access, bounded tensor streaming, and the `get<K>` decoding
  protocol. The existing
  `QvfReader` API remains available.
- Cumulative `qvf::validate` reports for container, manifest, payload,
  semantic and reference stages, using existing finding codes and limits.
  Early stages avoid reading later payloads; complete validation remains
  the default. `qvf-inspect` and the C++ conformance runner use the facade;
  the `read_qvf` executable is retained (WP-43).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-15

### Fixed

- Python and C++ section-creation APIs check duplicate, reserved and invalid
  IDs before writing payload members, including generated default IDs.
  A rejected ID leaves the archive unchanged, without orphan ZIP entries.

- Writer APIs expose the v0.3.0 fields: Python `add_job_spec` distinguishes
  omitted `basis` / `functional` from explicit `None` (JSON null); the C++
  JSON API accepts null and rejects non-string, non-null values. Both
  wavefunction writers accept `localization_reference_basis` and reject an
  explicitly empty value.

### Clarified

- Unrestricted NTOs use two `wavefunction.gto` sections per state, with
  alpha/beta channels paired by row and identical descending squared
  weights per spin (#12). A normalized state's weights sum to one across
  both spins. Full TDDFT/RPA sums remain permitted. Python/C++ writers and
  all three validators enforce channel/pair consistency; generated schema
  tables and positive/negative corpus cases cover the contract.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-15

qvf becomes the single source of the format for the vibe-qc family, and the
release merges into the format what the family's programs already write or
read (#11): run against 2,000 archives of vibe-qc 0.15–0.17, the 0.2.0
validator failed 463 of them (23 %) for four kinds of data that are valid
now, and vibe-view read three viewer hints the specification did not record.
All within QVF v1 (`qvf_version = 1`); none of the changes bumps it
([Decision](GOVERNANCE.md#2026-10-15--one-source-for-the-format-what-the-family-already-writes-and-reads-11)).

### Deprecated

- The `mo_metadata` keys `iao_charges`, `excitation_index` and
  `excitation_energy_ev` (spec § 5.3): valid, annotated `"deprecated": true`,
  and producers SHOULD NOT write them; the canonical carriers are the
  `atom_properties` member `iao_charge`, `state_index` with `state_ref`, and
  the state's `excitation_energy` in its `excited_states` section (#11).
- The empty string as a `job.spec` `functional` or `basis` (spec § 5.9): a
  valid, deprecated spelling of `null` (#11).
- Validators report no finding for a deprecated key or spelling, as for
  `provenance.hostname` and the legacy unit spellings.

### Added

- `localization_reference_basis`, an optional non-empty string of
  `$defs/MoMetadataPayload` (spec § 5.3): the minimal reference basis the
  intrinsic atomic orbitals were built from (Knizia, J. Chem. Theory Comput.
  2013, 9, 4834) (#11).
- `null` as a `job.spec` `functional` or `basis` (spec § 5.9,
  `$defs/JobSpecPayload`): the method takes none, distinct from an absent
  key, the engine's default (#11).
- The `viewer_defaults` hints vibe-view reads (spec § 3.4, #6): the
  per-section `energy_window` of `bands` and `dos.*` sections (`[min, max]`
  in eV relative to the Fermi level), the top-level `camera` (the shape of
  `$defs/Camera`) and `crossfade` (`{a, b, blend}`). Specified in the spec
  only: the schema lists `camera` and `crossfade` without checking their
  values, and a malformed hint never fails an archive. `camera` and
  `crossfade` are reserved section ids (`E_RESERVED_ID`); the Python and C++
  writers refuse them.
- `structure_ref` on a standalone `bonds` section (spec § 5.1, #4): the
  structure whose atoms the indices address; without it, the archive's first
  structure. Validators check every pair against the atom count of the named
  structure (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`). Python `add_bonds(..., structure_ref=)`
  and C++ `add_bonds(pairs, section_id, structure_ref)`.
- `@qvf/core` types `ViewerDefaults.camera` and `crossfade` and exports
  `CrossfadeHint`.
- Conformance corpus: `wavefunction_localized.qvf`, `job_set_methods.qvf`,
  `deprecated_spellings.qvf`, `bonds_structure_ref.qvf` and
  `viewer_hints.qvf` (71 archives); six negative archives for the new rules
  (100).

### Changed

- **qvf is the single source of the format** (`GOVERNANCE.md`, "QVF in the
  vibe-qc family"): the specification, schema, registry and reference
  validators change only here; a family program pins one qvf tag, vendors
  byte-identical copies checked in CI against that tag, keeps no derived
  schema (no v2 schema either; spec § 3.1 is the rule), and proposes a field
  here before it writes it (#11).
- `spec/legacy/README.md` and the `registry.json` `version_decisions` say
  what the frozen v2 schema is: qvf 0.1.0's v1 schema with `qvf_version` 1
  or 2, kept so that its `$id` resolves, used by no validator and no superset
  of the current v1 schema. A v2 archive is validated against the current v1
  schema with the warning `W_VERSION_WITHDRAWN` (spec § 3.1), as before (#11).
- `registry.json`: `x_vibesketch` lists the members vibe-sketch writes
  (`document`, `species`, `sdf`) since its picture moved to the canonical
  `preview` kind (#11).
- Section ids carry no meaning, and a consumer finds sections by kind and
  reference; the first structure of an archive is the first `structure`
  section `viewer_defaults.auto_open` lists, else the first in `sections`
  order (spec § 4.1, § 8.2). A clarification, no `qvf_version` bump
  ([Decision](GOVERNANCE.md#2026-10-14--section-ids-carry-no-meaning-the-first-structure)).
- `GOVERNANCE.md` records that QVF is the standard format of the vibe-qc
  family of programs, on the same terms as for every producer and consumer.
- `conformance/generate_corpus.py` runs as a script again: its entry point
  had preceded the sketch-document generators it calls.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-14

The format and toolkit changes since 0.1.0, all within QVF v1
(`qvf_version = 1`). The last group of format decisions makes QVF the document
format of vibe-sketch, the structure and reaction sketcher: chemical identity
on `structure` sections, the `reaction.scheme` and `preview` kinds, the member
field `media_type`, job sets, one media type and one macOS UTI for `.qvf`,
and the withdrawn `qvf_version` 2 read as a warning
([Decisions](GOVERNANCE.md#2026-10-14--sketch-documents-chemical-identity-reactionscheme-preview-job-sets)).
None of the changes bumps `qvf_version`.

### Deprecated

- `provenance.hostname` (spec § 3.2): producers SHOULD NOT emit it; consumers
  MUST ignore it except for display. The schema property is annotated
  `"deprecated": true`; existing archives remain valid. No `qvf_version`
  bump (D11, WP-07).
- The unit spellings `Eh`, `eV` and `Hartree` in a `{value, units}` object
  (`provenance.scf_energy`, `provenance.fermi_energy`): still valid there as
  `$defs/LegacyUnitName`, read as `hartree` and `ev`; producers SHOULD write
  the unit name (D12, WP-13).

### Added

- Chemical identity on `structure` sections (spec § 5.1): optional section
  fields `charge`, `multiplicity`, `name`, `smiles`, `inchi` and `inchikey`;
  the generic `label` is the species' compound label. Validators report a
  charge and multiplicity impossible for the atoms as the new error
  `E_CHARGE_MULTIPLICITY`, and, in an archive with one structure, a
  disagreement with `provenance.charge` / `provenance.multiplicity` as
  `E_ROOT_INCONSISTENT`. Python `add_structure` takes the six fields.
- `reaction.scheme`, a canonical kind (spec § 5.14): steps in reading order
  relating `structure` sections as reactants, reagents and products, each
  with an optional stoichiometric coefficient, under a `forward`,
  `equilibrium`, `retrosynthetic` or `resonance` arrow, with the conditions
  and the yield (`yield_percent`, `yield_text`). Roles are chemical whatever
  the arrow; the step key `energies` is reserved for reaction energies.
  Validators resolve every participant (`E_REF_UNRESOLVED`) and reject
  duplicate step ids and repeated participants (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`).
  Python `add_reaction_scheme`.
- `preview`, a canonical kind (spec § 5.15): a raster `thumbnail`
  (`image/png` or `image/jpeg`) and an optional `image` (also
  `image/svg+xml`), both opaque members with a required `media_type`; the
  archive's picture is the thumbnail of the first `preview` section, and SVG
  is self-contained and inert. Validators check the bytes against the media
  type (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`, `E_UTF8`). Python `add_preview` sniffs and
  checks the image type and stores the members uncompressed.
- `media_type`, an optional field of every member spec (spec § 4.2): the IANA
  media type of the member's bytes. Vendor sections may carry opaque members
  (binary without dtype and shape); Python `add_vendor_section` takes
  `opaque_members=`.
- Job sets (spec § 5.9): an archive may carry several `job.spec` sections,
  each naming its structure; `run.record` gains `job_ref` (the job it ran,
  resolved by validators) and `run_status` (its outcome), and
  `provenance.run_status` summarises the set. Python `add_run_record` takes
  `job_ref=` and `run_status=`, and `add_job_spec` writes `structure_ref` on
  the section object as well as in the payload.
- File identification (spec § 2.4): the extension `.qvf`, the media type
  `application/vnd.vibe-qc.qvf+zip` and the macOS Uniform Type Identifier
  `com.vibe-qc.qvf` (conforming to `public.zip-archive` and
  `public.content`), in `registry.json` (`file_type`) and as declarations to
  copy in `spec/file-type/` (`qvf-uti.plist`, `qvf-mime.xml`).
- `registry.json` registers the vendor namespace `x_vibesketch`.
- Finding codes `W_VERSION_WITHDRAWN` and `E_CHARGE_MULTIPLICITY`
  (Appendix B).
- C++ reference writer: `add_reaction_scheme`, `add_preview`,
  `set_structure_identity`, `remove_section`, `add_opaque_member` and an
  `add_vendor_section` overload with `OpaqueMember`s, `RunRecord::job_ref`
  and `run_status`; `qvf::MemberSpec::media_type` in the typed model; a member
  of an update whose path the archive already holds gets a fresh path
  (`<stem>.<n><suffix>`) instead of an exception, `begin_binary` included;
  `open_for_update` accepts `qvf_version: 2` and writes 1.
  `write_all_kinds` covers all 56 canonical kinds. The C++ and JavaScript
  validators implement every new rule with the codes and locations of the
  Python one (`@qvf/core` also types `media_type` and regenerates its kind
  list).
- Python reference writer: `label=` on every `add_*` method;
  `remove_section(id)`, which with an `add_*` under the same id replaces a
  section; `open_for_update` takes an archive's bytes as well as its path;
  `to_bytes(repack=True)` and `write(..., repack=True)` drop superseded
  entries; a member of an update whose default path the archive already
  holds gets a fresh path instead of an error.
- Conformance corpus: `reaction_scheme.qvf` (eight species with their
  identity, a three-step scheme, a preview, an opaque vendor member) and
  `job_set.qvf` (a job set halfway through); ten negative archives for the
  new rules.
- Spec § 5.8 "Sharing and sanitisation": run.record inputs, logs,
  attachments, `command`, and `files` filenames may carry paths, user names,
  and host names; producers SHOULD offer suppression or redaction; a toolkit
  `scrub` operation is the intended mechanism (WP-07).
- C++ `qvf::Json::erase(key)` (WP-07).
- Payload schemas for the spectra and analysis members (spec § 5.4, § 5.7,
  § 6): `$defs/SpectrumPayload` for the six 1-D spectra, with new optional
  `x_units`, `y_units`, `x`, `peaks`, `broadening`, `temperature_k`, `raman`
  and `uvvis` (`frequencies` keeps the x axis in the kind's § 4.3 unit);
  typed `NmrSpectrumPayload` and `EprSpectrumPayload`; strict `BondsPayload`
  (also the `structure` section's `bonds` member), `BondOrdersPayload` and
  `ScfHistoryPayload`; `QtaimPayload` with an optional `units` object
  (positions in Å unless declared, a provisional default); `SymmetryPayload`.
  Validators check each with `E_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA`, including the equal-length
  rule of a 1-D spectrum, so malformed payloads that used to pass now fail.
  Corpus `spectra_all.qvf`, `nmr.qvf`, `qtaim.qvf`, `symmetry.qvf`; three
  negative payload archives. Python `add_spectrum` checks array lengths and
  takes `x_units`, `y_units`, `peaks`, `broadening`; `add_topology_qtaim`
  takes `units`. No `qvf_version` bump (P01, P13, D05, D18, WP-11).
- Payload definitions for the geometry and wavefunction JSON members: volume
  `grid` and `reaction.path` `volume_grid` (`$defs/VolumeGridPayload`),
  `wavefunction.gto` `basis` and `mo_metadata` (`BasisPayload`,
  `MoMetadataPayload`), and the `metadata` / `waypoints` payloads of
  `trajectory`, `reaction.path`, `reaction.waypoints`, `scan.surface` and
  `vibrations`. Spec § 5.2, § 5.3 and § 5.5 gain payload tables, and § 6
  checks every JSON member that has a payload definition (`E_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA`).
  Additive, no `qvf_version` bump; a previously unconstrained malformed
  payload now fails validation. Corpus gains `trajectory.qvf`,
  `vibrations.qvf`, `scan_surface.qvf` and `reaction_path.qvf`; the negative
  corpus gains three `payload_*` archives (P01, D07, WP-10).
- Schema and spec § 5.6: optional members `phonon_bands.eigenvectors`
  (float64 `[n_q, n_modes, n_atoms, 3]`, or `[n_q, n_modes, n_atoms, 3, 2]`
  with the last axis `[re, im]`) and `phonon_dos.projected` (float64
  `[n_channels, n_points]`, rows labelled by `meta.channels`); the `dos.total`
  / `dos.projected` section fields `n_spin`, `smearing`, `smearing_type`,
  `fermi_energy_ev`, `n_electrons` and `channels` named as optional typed
  properties. The `atom_properties` roles (`mulliken_charge`,
  `loewdin_charge`, `hirshfeld_charge`, `iao_charge`, `spin_population`) are
  one list in the schema and spec § 5 / § 5.7. Corpus archives `phonons.qvf`
  and `atom_properties_all.qvf`. No `qvf_version` bump (D02, D03, D08, WP-04).
- Payload definitions for the periodic kinds and the run-record `files` index
  (spec § 5.6, § 5.8): strict `$defs/KpathPayload` (with `KpathSegment`),
  `FermiMeshPayload`, `QpathPayload`, `EosFitPayload` and
  `RunRecordFilesPayload`; typed-open `DosMetaPayload` (`dos.coop` /
  `dos.cohp` `meta`), `PhononMetaPayload` and the shared `DosChannel`. The
  Python validator checks each member against its definition
  (`E_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA`) through a `(kind, role)` table. No `qvf_version` bump
  (P01, P14, D07, WP-12).
- Spin axis on projections: `bands.projections` `[n_spin, n_k, n_bands,
  n_channels]` and `dos.projected.projections` `[n_spin, n_channels,
  n_points]`; the lower-rank shapes stay legal and mean `n_spin = 1`. New
  optional `bands.occupations` `[n_spin, n_k, n_bands]`. Both validators report
  shapes that disagree with `eigenvalues` as `E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`; Python and
  C++ `add_bands` take `occupations` (C++: a new overload), and the writers
  refuse disagreeing shapes (D04, WP-12).
- Conformance corpus: `bands_spin.qvf`, `dos.qvf`, `fermi_surface.qvf`,
  `eos.qvf`; negative corpus: `bands_spin_mismatch.qvf`,
  `eos_model_unknown.qvf` (WP-12).
- Unit vocabulary (spec § 4.3, "Unit names" and "Declared units";
  `$defs/UnitName`, 25 names from `angstrom` to `dimensionless`). Every payload
  `units` object (now also on the volume grid), the 1-D spectrum's `x_units`,
  `y_units` and `broadening.units`, and `ValueWithUnits.units` are typed as
  unit names, and declarations of units § 4.3 fixes are `const` in the payload
  definitions. New warning `W_UNIT_UNKNOWN` in the Python, C++ and JavaScript
  validators. Python module `qvf_units` (`UNITS`, `LEGACY_UNITS`, `is_unit`,
  `canonical`, `convert`, `fixed_units`) and C++ header `qvf/units.hpp`
  (`qvf::Unit`, `unit_name`, `parse_unit`, `canonical_unit`, `convert`), with
  CODATA 2018 length and energy conversions; JavaScript `UNIT_NAMES`,
  `isUnitName`, `canonicalUnit`. Python `add_volume`, `add_trajectory` and
  `add_scan_surface` take `units=`; C++ `Grid::units`, `Spectrum::x_units` /
  `y_units`. Corpus `units_declared.qvf`; negative `unit_unknown.qvf`,
  `unit_contradicts_fixed.qvf`. No `qvf_version` bump (P02, D12, WP-13).
- Root `energies` block (spec § 3.6, `$defs/Energies`): `total`, `method`,
  `components` (`nuclear_repulsion`, `electronic`, `one_electron`,
  `two_electron`, `exchange_correlation`, `exchange`, `correlation`,
  `dispersion`, `solvation`, `zpve`, `thermal`, `embedding`, `x_` keys),
  `by_method` and `units_note`. An energy stated for the method
  `provenance.method` names must agree with `provenance.scf_energy`, and
  `components.zpve` with `thermochemistry.zpve_eh`, within 1e-8 hartree; new
  finding code `E_ROOT_INCONSISTENT` in Appendix B and all three validators.
  No `qvf_version` bump (P05, WP-21).
- Canonical kinds `forces` (spec § 5.10: `gradient` float64 `[n_atoms, 3]`
  in hartree/bohr, the energy gradient, so forces are its negative; optional
  `stress` `[3, 3]` in hartree/bohr³ and strict `meta`) and `hessian` (spec
  § 5.11: `matrix` float64 `[3N, 3N]` in hartree/bohr², optional strict
  `meta` with `mass_weighted`, `projected`, `atom_masses_amu`), registered as
  promotions by maintainer decision; optional `vibrations.hessian_ref`.
  Validators check the shapes against the section's structure
  (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`) and resolve `meta.structure_ref` and `hessian_ref`
  (`E_REF_UNRESOLVED`). Writers: Python `set_energies`, `add_forces`,
  `add_hessian`, `add_vibrations(hessian_ref=)`; C++ `set_energies`,
  `add_forces`, `add_hessian`, `add_vibrations(..., hessian_ref)`; C ABI
  `qvf_set_energies_json`, `qvf_add_forces`, `qvf_add_hessian`. The
  JavaScript reader exports the `Energies` types. Corpus `forces_hessian.qvf`;
  negative corpus `forces_atom_count.qvf`, `hessian_not_square.qvf`,
  `energies_inconsistent.qvf`. No `qvf_version` bump (P06, P07, WP-21).
- Periodic grid semantics (spec § 5.2, `$defs/VolumeGridPayload`): optional
  grid fields `periodic` (three booleans), `includes_endpoint` (default
  `true`, cube style: the last plane repeats the first; `false`, CHGCAR style:
  `shape[a]` planes per period) and `structure_ref`. § 5.2 is rewritten around
  the point positions, a cube-vs-CHGCAR worked example and the rule that a
  consumer tiling a cube-style grid MUST drop the duplicated plane. All three
  validators check that a periodic axis is periodic in the grid's structure
  and that `voxel_vectors[a] × (shape[a] − 1)` (or `× shape[a]`) equals the
  lattice row in bohr within 1e-6 relative (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`), and
  resolve a grid `structure_ref` (`E_REF_UNRESOLVED`). This resolves a silent
  cube/CHGCAR interoperability bug. No `qvf_version` bump (P11, WP-25).
- Canonical kinds `volume.vector` (`[nx, ny, nz, 3]`,
  `$defs/Volume4DVectorBinary`), `volume.complex` (`[nx, ny, nz, 2]`, last
  axis `[re, im]`, `$defs/Volume4DComplexBinary`), `volume.series`
  (`[n, nx, ny, nz]` with a required strict `axis` member,
  `$defs/VolumeSeriesAxisPayload`: `kind` time / frame / state / custom,
  `values`, `units`, `labels`, `trajectory_ref`) and `volume.laplacian`
  (∇²ρ in e/bohr⁵, a new § 4.3 row), registered as promotions by maintainer
  decision. Validators check the rank and trailing axis of each, a series
  axis against its slabs (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`) and its `trajectory_ref`
  (`E_REF_UNRESOLVED`); an unknown series axis unit is `W_UNIT_UNKNOWN`.
  `reaction.path` `frame_volumes` + `volume_grid` are documented as the older
  form of a frame `volume.series`, which producers SHOULD prefer; both stay
  valid. Writers: Python `add_volume(..., periodic=, includes_endpoint=,
  structure_ref=, axis=)` with 4-D data for the new kinds; C++
  `Grid::periodic` / `includes_endpoint` / `structure_ref`, `add_volume` for
  the new kinds and `add_volume_series`; C ABI `qvf_add_volume` and
  `qvf_add_volume_series` (the first generic volume entry points). The
  JavaScript reader exports `BOHR_PER_ANGSTROM`. Corpus `volume_periodic.qvf`,
  `volume_vector.qvf`, `volume_complex.qvf`, `volume_series.qvf`,
  `volume_laplacian.qvf`; negative corpus `volume_periodic_span.qvf`,
  `volume_endpoint_count.qvf`, `volume_series_axis_length.qvf`,
  `volume_vector_trailing_axis.qvf`. No `qvf_version` bump (P11, WP-25).
- Canonical kind `wavefunction.bloch`, **provisional** (spec § 5.3.1): the
  k-resolved Bloch orbitals of a periodic system over the `wavefunction.gto`
  `basis` payload, with a strict `kpoints` payload
  (`$defs/BlochKpointsPayload`: fractional k-points, `weights` summing to 1,
  `labels`, `mesh`, `shift`, `time_reversal`), a strict `mo_metadata`
  (`$defs/BlochMoMetadataPayload`: `spin`, `n_spin`, `n_mo`, `n_ao`,
  `complex`, `k_point_convention`, `orbital_kind`, `n_mo_per_k`,
  `fermi_energy`), complex `mo_coefficients` float64 `[n_k, n_spin, n_mo,
  n_ao, 2]`, and `energies` (hartree) and `occupations` `[n_k, n_spin,
  n_mo]`. The spec states the Bloch sum φ_μk(r) = N^(−1/2) Σ_T e^{+ik·T}
  χ_μ(r − T). Promoted from `x_vibeqc.bloch_wavefunction` ahead of the
  two-producer threshold by maintainer decision; the registry `promotions`
  entry carries `"status": "provisional"` until a second producer ships it.
  The Python, C++ and JavaScript validators check the member shapes, the
  weights and a periodic structure (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`,
  `E_REF_UNRESOLVED`). Writers: Python `add_wavefunction_bloch`, C++
  `WavefunctionBloch` + `add_wavefunction_bloch`, C ABI
  `qvf_add_wavefunction_bloch`. Corpus `bloch.qvf` (with a `bands` section at
  the same k-points); negative corpus `bloch_weights_sum.qvf`,
  `bloch_coefficients_trailing_axis.qvf`, `bloch_occupations_shape.qvf`,
  `bloch_structure_molecular.qvf`. Spec § 7.5 records provisional
  promotions and § 9 item 2 what is still open. No `qvf_version` bump (P15,
  WP-30).
- `atom_properties` roles (spec § 5 table, § 5.7, schema
  `$defs/SectionAtomProperties`): 17 new scalar roles, float64 `[n_atoms]`
  (`cm5_charge`, `chelpg_charge`, `resp_charge`, `esp_charge`, `nbo_charge`,
  `mbis_charge`, `bader_charge`, `ddec_charge`, `valence`, `bonded_valence`,
  `fukui_plus`, `fukui_minus`, `fukui_zero`, `dual_descriptor`,
  `atomic_energy_eh`, `atomic_volume_bohr3`, `nmr_shielding_iso_ppm`), two
  vector roles, float64 `[n_atoms, 3]` (`$defs/AtomVectorBinary`:
  `magnetic_moment` in μB and `force_eh_bohr`, the energy gradient in
  hartree/bohr), and `custom.<name>` roles described by a strict `meta`
  member (`$defs/AtomPropertiesMetaPayload`: `units`, `description`,
  `kind`). Spec § 5.7 gains a role table with unit and sign conventions.
  Validators report a `custom.*` member without a `meta` entry as
  `E_MEMBER_MALFORMED` (Python, C++, JavaScript). Corpus
  `atom_properties_extended.qvf` and four negative archives
  (`atom_properties_custom_no_meta.qvf`,
  `atom_properties_custom_meta_entry_missing.qvf`,
  `atom_properties_vector_shape.qvf`, `atom_properties_role_unknown.qvf`).
  No `qvf_version` bump (P10, WP-24).
- Root `metadata` block (spec § 3.5, `$defs/Metadata`): `title`,
  `description`, `created_utc`, `modified_utc`, `uuid`, `authors`
  (`$defs/MetadataAuthor`), `license`, `doi`, `keywords`, `derived_from`,
  `tags`; strict, with the time stamps (ISO 8601 UTC, `Z`) and the RFC 4122
  `uuid` pattern-checked by the schema. Authors' `email` and `affiliation`
  are personal data that producers SHOULD NOT emit by default. No
  `qvf_version` bump (P03, WP-20).
- Section fields `structure_ref`, `run_ref` and `group` on any section (spec
  § 4.1). All three validators (Python, C++, JS) report a `structure_ref`
  that does not name a `structure` section, or a `run_ref` that does not name
  a `run.record`, as `E_REF_UNRESOLVED`. A section's `structure_ref` takes
  precedence over the one in a `wavefunction.gto` `basis` payload. No
  `qvf_version` bump (P04, WP-20).
- Writers: Python `set_metadata(**fields)` and `annotate_section(section_id,
  structure_ref=, run_ref=, group=, label=)`; C++ `set_metadata(Json)`,
  `set_section_field(id, key, value)` and `annotate_section(id,
  structure_ref, run_ref, group)`; C ABI `qvf_set_metadata_json` and
  `qvf_annotate_section`. The JS model types gain `Metadata`,
  `MetadataAuthor` and the three section fields (WP-20).
- Conformance corpus: `multi_structure.qvf`; negative corpus:
  `structure_ref_wrong_kind.qvf`, `run_ref_unresolved.qvf`,
  `trajectory_ref_wrong_kind.qvf`, `metadata_uuid_invalid.qvf` (WP-20).
- Conformance corpus v2 and a C++ runner. Every canonical kind of
  `registry.json` now has a positive archive, and
  `python/tests/test_corpus_coverage.py` keeps it so (new: `bonds.qvf`,
  `volume_orbital.qvf`, `volume_spin.qvf`, `volume_elf.qvf`,
  `volume_potential.qvf`, `volume_rdg.qvf`, `volume_generic.qvf`,
  `volume_difference.qvf`, `basis_ao.qvf`, `dos_coop.qvf`, `citations.qvf`).
  Edge cases: `wavefunction_uhf.qvf`; `wavefunction_cartesian.qvf`, a
  `pure: false` d shell whose Appendix A.1 self-overlaps (1 axial, 1/3 for
  `d_xy`) are stored in an `x_conformance.overlap_diagonal` vendor section;
  `structure_wire_1d.qvf`; `reaction_path_variable_cell.qvf`; `zip64.qvf`
  (ZIP64 structures forced on small members) and `data_descriptor.qvf`
  (streamed members). A new `conformance/legacy/` holds an archive stamped
  `qvf_version: 2`, which the validators reject with `E_VERSION` pending a
  maintainer decision; the Python and JavaScript runners treat it like
  `negative/`. `cpp/examples/run_conformance.cpp` implements the whole check
  format for the C++ reader (CTest `qvf_conformance`, and a step in both CI
  pipelines); it lists `zip64.qvf` as a known gap, because the C++ ZIP layer
  has no ZIP64 yet. No spec or schema change, no `qvf_version` bump (WP-14).
- Typed `provenance` fields (spec § 3.2, now a table of every recognised
  field): `software` (`$defs/ProvenanceSoftware`: `name`, `version`, `url`),
  `git_commit` (7 to 64 hexadecimal characters), `n_threads`, `n_mpi_ranks`,
  `n_gpus`, `started_utc` and `finished_utc` (ISO 8601 UTC); the block stays
  open and `wall_seconds` keeps its name. `provenance.n_electrons` must agree
  with `basis.n_electrons`. Python `set_provenance` and C++ `set_provenance`
  check them. No `qvf_version` bump (P18, WP-27).
- Typed `job.spec` fields (spec § 5.9): `structure_ref`, `solvation`
  (`model`, `solvent`, `epsilon`), `dispersion`, `relativistic`, `scf`
  (`convergence`, `max_iterations`, `guess`, `damping`), `geometry`
  (`convergence`, `max_steps`, `coordinates`) and `resources` (`n_cores`,
  `memory_mb`, `walltime_s`; hints, not requirements); the blocks are strict
  with `x_` keys allowed, the root stays open and engine keywords stay under
  `options`. All three validators resolve a payload's `structure_ref` with
  `E_REF_UNRESOLVED`. Python `add_job_spec` takes the new fields as
  arguments, C++ `add_job_spec(Json)` checks them, and the C ABI gains
  `qvf_add_job_spec_json`. Corpus `job_spec_full.qvf` and
  `provenance_full.qvf`; negative `job_spec_structure_ref_wrong_kind.qvf`,
  `provenance_git_commit_not_hex.qvf`, `provenance_started_utc_not_utc.qvf`.
  The JS model types gain the provenance fields. No `qvf_version` bump (P18,
  WP-27).
- Optional member `size` on every member spec (`$defs/MemberSize`, spec
  § 4.2): the uncompressed byte count of the stored member, equal to the size
  its ZIP entry records. The Python and C++ writers write it for every
  member; the Python, C++ and JavaScript validators check it against the
  central directory before reading the member (`E_BINARY_SIZE`, wording
  widened; a malformed `size` is `E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`), and the readers refuse
  such a member. No `qvf_version` bump (P19, WP-28).
- Spec § 2.3 "Updating an archive in place": an update appends entries,
  writes a new `manifest.json` last and never reuses another entry's name;
  the previous manifest and replaced members are orphans (`W_ORPHAN_MEMBER`)
  that consumers ignore; consumers read the last `manifest.json`; `repack`
  removes orphans; `metadata.modified_utc`, `run.record.sequence` and
  `provenance.run_status` record the update. Validators report a duplicated
  `manifest.json` as `W_ORPHAN_MEMBER` for each superseded copy instead of
  `E_ZIP_DUPLICATE_ENTRY`, a clarification of the 2026-10-07 duplicate rule;
  the Python, C++ and JavaScript readers open such archives. No `qvf_version`
  bump (P19, WP-28).
- Optional root `byte_order`, `const: "little"` (spec § 2.2, § 3.1): states
  the byte order every v1 archive already has; any other value fails the
  schema (`E_SCHEMA`) and the readers refuse it. Both writers emit it; v2
  moves the byte order into the dtype names (V2-01). No `qvf_version` bump
  (P20, WP-28).
- Conformance corpus `updated_in_place.qvf` (two `manifest.json` entries, an
  orphaned member, validates with warnings) and `size_declared.qvf`; negative
  corpus `member_size_mismatch.qvf` and `byte_order_big.qvf` (WP-28).
- Trajectory extensions (spec § 4.3, § 5.5): optional `trajectory` members
  `lattice` (float64 `[3, 3]` or `[n_frames, 3, 3]` in the **structure
  convention**, rows in Å, unlike `reaction.path.lattice`), `velocities`
  (`[n_frames, n_atoms, 3]`, Å/fs), `gradient` (`[n_frames, n_atoms, 3]`, the
  energy gradient in hartree/bohr; forces are its negative), `times` (fs),
  binary `energies` (hartree), `cell_volumes` (Å³) and `temperatures`
  (kelvin), each `[n_frames]`; `reaction.path` gains `velocities`,
  `gradient`, `times` and `energies`. `coords` may be float32 with
  `metadata.precision: "float32"` (`$defs/TrajectoryCoords` widened). Metadata
  gains `ensemble` and `timestep_fs`; `pbc` is required with a trajectory
  `lattice`. Schema `$defs/TrajectoryLattice`, `TrajectoryFrameVectors`,
  `TrajectoryFrameScalars` and the shared `TrajectoryMetadataCommon`; § 4.3
  "Lattice conventions" states all three cell carriers. The Python, C++ and
  JavaScript validators check the per-frame extents against `coords`, the
  float32 / `precision` rule, binary `energies` against `metadata.energies`
  (1e-10 hartree) and `lattice` / `pbc` (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`). Writers:
  Python `add_trajectory(..., lattice=, velocities=, gradient=, times=,
  energies=, cell_volumes=, temperatures=, precision=)` and
  `add_reaction_path(..., velocities=, gradient=, times=, energies=)`; C++
  `TrajectoryExtras`, `add_trajectory(metadata, coords, extras)` with
  `Lattice` and `std::vector<Lattice>` overloads, `add_reaction_path(...,
  lattice, extras)`; C ABI `qvf_add_trajectory`. Corpus `md_periodic.qvf`;
  negative corpus `trajectory_lattice_without_pbc.qvf`,
  `trajectory_float32_without_precision.qvf`,
  `trajectory_velocities_frame_count.qvf`,
  `trajectory_energies_disagree.qvf`. No `qvf_version` bump (P12, D06, WP-26).
- C++ container layer `qvf/container.hpp` (`qvf::container`): `ZipWriter`
  over a `FileSink`, `MemorySink` or `CallbackSink`, with whole or streamed
  entries (`begin` -> `EntrySink`: CRC-32, SHA-256 and DEFLATE on the fly;
  local headers patched on seekable sinks, data descriptors on others),
  ZIP64 extra fields, end record and locator when a size, offset or entry
  count needs them or when forced, `append(path)` (existing records kept as
  they are) and `allow_repeated_name()` for the superseded `manifest.json` of
  spec § 2.3; `ZipReader` with ZIP64 and data-descriptor support, CRC-32 and
  local-header checks, a repeated name resolved to its last record, and
  `read_into()` streaming an entry under `Limits`, which moved here
  (`qvf::Limits` is an alias). The DEFLATE and INFLATE codecs stream. The C++
  reader now opens `zip64.qvf`: the known gap and the sanitizer jobs' skip are
  gone (D13, WP-40).
- C++ `QvfWriter` streaming and update: `QvfWriter(source, path)` writes
  members to the file as they are added; `begin_binary(section_id, role,
  dtype, shape)` returns a `MemberSink` that computes sha256 and size on the
  fly; `open_for_update(path)` updates an archive in place as spec § 2.3
  prescribes (members appended, a new `manifest.json` last, the superseded
  one kept as an orphan, `metadata.modified_utc` stamped, no other entry
  name reused); `write()` finishes a bound writer; `force_zip64`; free
  function `repack(in, out)` drops orphans and superseded manifests
  (D19, P19, WP-40).
- Python `QvfWriter.open_for_update(path)` (spec § 2.3 through `zipfile`
  mode `"a"`: members appended, a new `manifest.json` last, the superseded
  one kept, `metadata.modified_utc` stamped, no other entry name reused),
  module function `repack(src, dst)`, and `force_zip64=` on `to_bytes()` /
  `write()` (D19, P19, WP-40).
- `cpp/fuzz/zip_reader_fuzzer.cpp`, a libFuzzer target over the ZIP reader
  and the validator, built with `-DQVF_FUZZ=ON` (clang; a mutation driver
  stands in where clang has no libFuzzer runtime); not run in CI yet (WP-40).
- Canonical kinds `excited_states` (spec § 5.12: one strict JSON member
  `states`, `$defs/ExcitedStatesPayload`, with per-state `index`,
  `excitation_energy` (SHOULD be `ev`), `total_energy`, `multiplicity`,
  `symmetry`, `oscillator_strength`, `rotatory_strength_cgs` (10⁻⁴⁰ esu²·cm²),
  `transition_dipole` and `transition_magnetic_dipole` (atomic units),
  `contributions`, `nto_ref`, `density_ref`, a strict `meta`, and the section
  field `wavefunction_ref`) and `volume.transition_density` (spec § 5.2, e/bohr³,
  optional section fields `excited_states_ref` and `state_index`), registered as
  promotions by maintainer decision. Natural transition orbitals are two
  `wavefunction.gto` sections per state; `mo_metadata` gains `state_index` and
  `nto_role` (`hole` / `particle`), and `state_ref` names the `excited_states`
  section (spec § 5.3). A one-dimensional spectrum payload gains `states_ref`,
  which makes `peaks[].assignment.state_index` a state `index` (spec § 5.4).
  All three validators report repeated or descending state indices, a wrong
  `n_states` and a contribution beyond the reference wavefunction's orbital
  rows (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`), and an unresolved `wavefunction_ref`,
  `nto_ref`, `density_ref`, `states_ref`, `excited_states_ref` or
  `state_index` (`E_REF_UNRESOLVED`); `meta.units` joins the unit-name rule.
  No `qvf_version` bump (P08, WP-22).
- Writers: Python `add_excited_states(states, *, meta=, wavefunction_ref=,
  section_id=)`, `add_volume("volume.transition_density", ...,
  excited_states_ref=, state_index=)` and `add_wavefunction_gto(...,
  state_ref=, state_index=, nto_role=)`; C++ `add_excited_states`,
  `add_volume_transition_density` and the `WavefunctionGTO` fields
  `state_ref`, `state_index`, `nto_role`; C ABI
  `qvf_add_excited_states_json`. `js/src/kinds.ts` is regenerated. Corpus
  `tddft.qvf` (water: ground-state wavefunction, three states, an NTO pair, a
  transition density and the UV-Vis stick spectrum of the table); negative
  corpus `excited_states_index_duplicate.qvf`,
  `excited_states_nto_ref_wrong_kind.qvf`,
  `excited_states_to_mo_out_of_range.qvf` (WP-22).
- `wavefunction.gto` extensions (spec § 5.3, Appendix A.1): effective core
  potentials specified (`basis.ecp`: radial functions
  `Σ c r^(n−2) exp(−α r²)` with `powers` = n, a new optional `local` flag for
  the local part, which has the centre's highest `l`); `basis.n_electrons`
  (`Σ Z − Σ n_core_electrons − charge`) must equal the summed occupations and
  `provenance.n_electrons`; `restricted_open` and `generalized` layouts
  (`generalized`: AO axis doubled as `[α AOs…, β AOs…]`, requires
  `complex: true`); `complex: true` means a trailing `[re, im]` axis on every
  coefficient member; optional float64 `[n_ao, n_ao]` members `overlap`,
  `density_matrix`, `density_matrix_alpha` + `density_matrix_beta`
  (`$defs/WavefunctionAoMatrix`). Validators check coefficient ranks,
  `symmetry_labels` lengths, matrix shapes and pairing and the electron count
  (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`, `E_ROOT_INCONSISTENT` against provenance), and, when
  `overlap` is present, its diagonal against the Appendix A.1 self-overlaps:
  new finding code `E_NORMALIZATION` in Appendix B and all three validators
  (Python, C++, JavaScript). Producers SHOULD write `overlap`. No
  `qvf_version` bump (P09, WP-23).
- Writers: Python `add_wavefunction_gto(..., spin=, ecp=, n_electrons=,
  symmetry_labels=, overlap=, density_matrix=, density_matrix_alpha=,
  density_matrix_beta=, complex_coefficients=)`; C++ `WavefunctionGTO`
  fields `spin`, `complex_coefficients`, `ecp`, `n_electrons`,
  `symmetry_labels` (and `_alpha` / `_beta`), `overlap`, `density_matrix`,
  `density_matrix_alpha`, `density_matrix_beta`, and
  `QvfWriter::set_wavefunction_overlap` / `set_wavefunction_ecp`; C ABI
  `qvf_add_wavefunction_gto_unrestricted`, `qvf_set_wavefunction_overlap`,
  `qvf_set_wavefunction_ecp_json` (WP-23).
- Conformance corpus: `wavefunction_ecp.qvf`, `wavefunction_overlap.qvf`
  (its `expected.json` records the overlap diagonal); negative corpus:
  `wavefunction_normalization.qvf` (`E_NORMALIZATION`),
  `wavefunction_n_electrons.qvf`, `wavefunction_complex_rank2.qvf` (WP-23).
- Canonical kinds `properties.electric`, `properties.elastic` and
  `properties.dielectric` (spec § 5.13, "Property kinds"), each with one
  strict JSON member `properties` (`$defs/ElectricPropertiesPayload`,
  `ElasticPropertiesPayload`, `DielectricPropertiesPayload`), registered as
  promotions by maintainer decision. Electric: `dipole` (debye), `quadrupole`
  (debye·Å, Buckingham or Cartesian, with a `traceless` flag), `octupole`,
  `polarizability` and `hyperpolarizability` (atomic units) and `origin`.
  Elastic: the symmetric 6 × 6 Voigt `stiffness` in GPa, `compliance`, moduli
  and their `average` scheme. Dielectric: `electronic`, `ionic` and `static`
  tensors, one Born tensor per atom in e, and the piezoelectric tensor in
  C/m². Fixed units, with a typed `units` object that restates them where the
  vocabulary has a name (spec § 4.3 gains the rows). Validators in Python, C++
  and JavaScript check symmetric elastic matrices, `static` = `electronic` +
  `ionic` and the Born tensor count (`E_MEMBER_MALFORMED`), and an electric
  dipole against the root `dipole_moment` within 1e-6 debye
  (`E_ROOT_INCONSISTENT`). Writers: Python `add_electric_properties`,
  `add_elastic_properties`, `add_dielectric_properties`; C++ the same names
  taking the payload as JSON; C ABI `qvf_add_electric_properties_json`,
  `qvf_add_elastic_properties_json`, `qvf_add_dielectric_properties_json`.
  Corpus `properties_molecular.qvf` and `properties_periodic.qvf`; negative
  corpus `elastic_not_symmetric.qvf`, `dielectric_static_mismatch.qvf`,
  `dielectric_born_atom_count.qvf`, `electric_dipole_inconsistent.qvf`. No
  `qvf_version` bump (P14, P17, WP-29).
- Schema-driven generated tables (design § 4–5): `scripts/gen_kinds.py`
  (standard library only) reads `spec/qvf_manifest.schema.json`,
  `registry.json` and spec Appendix B and writes, deterministically,
  `cpp/include/qvf/kinds_generated.hpp` (`namespace qvf::gen`: `KindInfo` /
  `RoleInfo` per canonical kind with formats, dtypes, rank bounds and payload
  definitions, `kind_info()`, `kCanonicalKinds`, `payload_def()`, the `Unit`
  enum with `unit_name()` / `parse_unit()`, the finding codes, the schema
  `$id`), `python/qvf_kinds.py` (the same tables, `PAYLOAD_DEFS`,
  `FIXED_UNITS`), and the compiled schema `cpp/src/qvf_schema_table.hpp` /
  `js/src/schemaTable.ts`. `--check` fails on drift; a test, both CI pipelines
  and `scripts/make_archive.sh` run it. The generator refuses JSON Schema
  keywords outside the supported subset, unsupported regular expressions, an
  unmapped `*Payload` definition and a registry that disagrees with the
  schema (WP-41).
- A table-driven JSON Schema checker for the C++ and JavaScript validators
  (`cpp/src/qvf_schema_check.hpp`, `js/src/schemaCheck.ts`): an interpreter
  of the generated instruction table, with patterns on a Pike VM over code
  points and no schema engine or `<regex>`. Both validators now report
  `E_SCHEMA` for `manifest.json` and `E_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA` for every JSON member
  with a payload definition, at the same locations as the Python validator
  (`jsonschema`), and the equal-length rule of a 1-D spectrum.
  `qvf::ValidationOptions::schema_check` (C++) and `schemaCheck` (JS) disable
  the check (then `W_SCHEMA_SKIPPED`); the C++ and JS conformance runners take
  `--no-schema-check`. `python/tests/test_schema_checker_parity.py` holds both
  checkers to `jsonschema` on the positive, negative and legacy corpora and on
  mutated corpus documents (WP-41).
- Typed, lossless manifest model (design § 4): C++ `qvf/model.hpp`
  (`Manifest`, `Section`, `MemberSpec` with `from_json` / `to_json`, unknown
  and wrongly typed fields kept in `extra`) exposed as
  `QvfReader::typed_manifest()`, and Python `qvf_model` (dataclasses,
  `QvfReader.typed_manifest`); round-trip tests over every conformance
  manifest (CTest `qvf_model_roundtrip`, `python/tests/test_model.py`). The
  writers do not use it yet (WP-41).

### Changed

- Validators read an archive stamped with the withdrawn `qvf_version: 2` as
  version 1, the JSON Schema check included, and report the warning
  `W_VERSION_WITHDRAWN` instead of the error `E_VERSION`, as spec § 3.1 and
  `registry.json` (`readable_versions`) asked of consumers; the legacy corpus
  expects the warning. Python `QvfWriter.open_for_update` accepts such an
  archive and writes `qvf_version: 1` and the v1 `schema_uri`.
- A pending archive carries at least one `job.spec` section, no longer
  exactly one (spec § 5.9).
- The conformance runner reports the legacy corpus as "judged as expected".
- Reference writers drop a `hostname` provenance key by default; opt in with
  Python `set_provenance(..., allow_hostname=True)` or C++
  `set_provenance(prov, /*allow_hostname=*/true)`. The C ABI
  `qvf_set_provenance_json` always drops it and now reports malformed JSON as
  an error instead of writing it verbatim (WP-07).
- Schema descriptions no longer cite internal documents or implementation
  details, and every spec citation uses the current section number and
  title; descriptions only, no contract change (D01, WP-02).
- The `Extensions` schema description now says keys carry their `x_`
  prefix, matching the pattern, spec § 7.4, and the vendor corpus archive.
- Writer APIs follow the schema: Python `add_atom_properties` gains
  `hirshfeld_charge=` and `iao_charge=`; C++ gains
  `add_atom_properties(std::map<std::string, std::vector<double>>)` and
  `add_atom_property(role, values)`, plus an `std::initializer_list` overload
  that keeps `add_atom_properties({q0, q1})` unambiguous; the C ABI gains
  `qvf_add_atom_property`. Both writers now reject `atom_properties` roles of
  different lengths, and phonon eigenvectors or a projected phonon DOS of the
  wrong rank, trailing axes, dtype or extent, before writing anything; the
  Python writer splits complex eigenvectors into the `[re, im]` form (D02,
  D03, WP-04).
- Spec § 5.6 is rewritten around per-member payload tables with a *Spin
  axis* rule; § 5.8 documents the `files` index in a table. The schema
  requires `bands.projections` to be float64 (WP-12).
- The negative-corpus runners hold an expectation of a schema-only code
  (`E_SCHEMA`, `E_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA`) only against a validator that runs the
  JSON Schema check (WP-12).
- The writers write the unit names `hartree` and `ev` for
  `set_provenance(scf_energy_eh=, fermi_energy_ev=)` and refuse a declared
  unit that is not a unit name or that contradicts a fixed unit; a payload
  `units` value outside the vocabulary, previously accepted by the schema, now
  fails with `E_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA`. `qvf::kBohrPerAngstrom` moved to
  `qvf/units.hpp`, which `qvf/qvf.hpp` includes (WP-13).
- Writer APIs follow the enlarged `atom_properties` list: Python
  `add_atom_properties` takes every role by keyword plus `custom={name:
  (array, entry)}` and `meta=` and writes the `meta` member; C++ gains
  `add_atom_vector_property` and `set_atom_properties_meta`, its map overload
  and `add_atom_property` accept the enlarged scalar list and scalar custom
  roles; the C ABI gains `qvf_add_atom_vector_property` and
  `qvf_set_atom_properties_meta_json`, and `qvf_add_atom_property` accepts the
  enlarged scalar list. Roles named `cm5_charge` or `bader_charge` were
  rejected as unknown before and are valid now (P10, WP-24).
- The reference writers (Python, C++, and through it the C ABI) add
  `metadata.created_utc` and a random version-4 `metadata.uuid` to every
  archive by default, made once per writer; opt out with
  `QvfWriter(..., auto_metadata=False)` or C++ `w.auto_metadata = false`. A
  consumer that validates against an older vendored schema rejects the new
  root key until it updates. The positive conformance generator opts out, so
  the frozen archives keep their manifests (WP-20).
- Validators now check that a `reaction.waypoints` `trajectory_ref` names a
  `trajectory` section, as spec § 6 already required, not merely an existing
  one (`E_REF_UNRESOLVED`, WP-20).
- `set_provenance` (Python and C++, so also `qvf_set_provenance_json`) and
  `add_job_spec` check the typed fields they write and refuse a wrong value
  (`ValueError`, `std::runtime_error`, a non-zero C return) before anything
  changes; the C++ `set_provenance` now also refuses a provenance that is not
  a JSON object. Both Python writer checks match whole strings, so a time
  stamp or hash with a trailing newline is refused (WP-27).
- Trajectory writers check every member before writing: Python
  `add_trajectory` writes float32 `coords` when the metadata already names
  `precision: "float32"`, and refuses a lattice without `pbc` or a periodic
  `pbc` without a lattice; Python and C++ `add_reaction_path` keep float64
  coordinates and refuse a metadata `precision` of `"float32"`; C++
  `add_trajectory` adds `precision: "float32"` for float32 coordinates and
  refuses raw metadata that does not parse. Validators now enforce that
  `metadata.precision` agrees with the dtype of `coords`, as spec § 5.5
  already required (WP-26).
- Both reference writers write `manifest.json` last (still STOREd), after the
  members, as spec § 2.1 recommends; it used to be the first entry. The C++
  `write(path)` streams the archive to the file instead of building it in
  memory, and a 32-bit archive's ZIP encoding is unchanged byte for byte.
  The C++ ZIP writer sets the UTF-8 flag (bit 11) for non-ASCII entry names
  (WP-40).
- The C++ reader verifies each entry's CRC-32 and that its local header names
  the same entry as the central directory (as the Python and JavaScript
  readers do), reports both as `E_ZIP_UNREADABLE`, and applies every
  `Limits` cap (member and total size, ratio) to member reads. Its inflater
  rejects DEFLATE streams zlib rejects too (a stored block whose length check
  fails, more than 286/30 codes, a code-length repeat past the end, no
  end-of-block code).
  `QvfReader::open` and `validate_file` read from the file on demand instead
  of loading it whole (WP-40).
- Spec § 5.3 now says what `mo_metadata.state_ref` refers to for natural
  transition orbitals (it was "not yet specified"), and the writers'
  `add_spectrum` refuses a one-dimensional payload whose `states_ref` names no
  `excited_states` section already added (WP-22).
- Spec § 9 item 5 (Cartesian shells) now points producers at the `overlap`
  check. The Python and C++ `add_wavefunction_gto` refuse coefficient
  matrices whose AO extent is not the basis's `n_ao` (2 `n_ao` for
  `generalized`), and check everything before writing anything; a
  `generalized` `mo_metadata` without `complex: true` now fails the schema
  (`E_PAYLOAD_SCHEMA`), a layout no archive could use before (WP-23).
- The finding code `E_ROOT_INCONSISTENT` now also covers a section that
  restates a root block: a `properties.electric` dipole that differs from the
  root `dipole_moment`. The code is not renamed (spec § 3.3, § 5.13,
  Appendix B; WP-29).

- The C++ and JavaScript validators run the JSON Schema by default, so an
  archive that only the schema rejects (for example `byte_order` `"big"` or a
  payload outside its definition) is now invalid to them, as it already was
  to the Python validator with `jsonschema`; their negative-corpus runners
  hold the schema-only expectations and compare the other codes exactly.
  The C++ reader's refusal of a `byte_order` other than `"little"` now starts
  with `E_SCHEMA:` (WP-41).
- `qvf::Unit`, `unit_name()`, `parse_unit()` and the canonical kinds come from
  the generated `qvf/kinds_generated.hpp` (`qvf/units.hpp` re-exports the unit
  names; enumerator names are unchanged), `qvf::Source` moved to
  `qvf/model.hpp` (still included by `qvf/qvf.hpp`), and `qvf_reader`'s
  canonical kinds, payload definitions and finding codes and `qvf_units`'s
  vocabulary come from `qvf_kinds` instead of hand-kept copies and a schema
  read at import. A new payload definition is wired to its `(kind, role)` in
  `PAYLOAD_DEFS` of `scripts/gen_kinds.py`. The C++ JSON parser now joins an
  escaped surrogate pair into one code point (WP-41).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

First public release of the toolkit, implementing QVF v1 (`qvf_version = 1`).
The release date is the date of the first public commit of this repository.
The format decisions below were taken earlier, while development still took
place in a private monorepo (see the History section of
[`README.md`](README.md)); each bullet carries the date of the decision as
recorded in `GOVERNANCE.md`.

### Format decisions

Newest first. None of them changed `qvf_version`.

- 2026-08-05 - `basis.ao`: optional `cartesian_powers` (`[l_x, l_y, l_z]`)
  names the components of Cartesian (`pure: false`) shells; `angular_momentum`
  keeps its shape and stays required. No `qvf_version` bump.
  [Decision](GOVERNANCE.md#2026-08-05--basisao-cartesian-components-named-by-cartesian_powers).
- 2026-07-26 - `structure`: the optional biomolecule fields `chains`,
  `residues`, `secondary_structure` and the new `b_factors` (plus per-atom
  `b_factor`) are schema'd as optional properties; a requested v3 schema was
  declined. No `qvf_version` bump.
  [Decision](GOVERNANCE.md#2026-07-26--biomolecule-metadata-schemad-on-structure-no-v3).
- 2026-07-25 - `job.spec`: new canonical kind carrying a declarative job
  specification; `provenance.run_status` formalized with the values
  `pending`, `running`, `converged` and `failed`. No `qvf_version` bump.
  [Decision](GOVERNANCE.md#2026-07-25--jobspec-canonical-kind--run_status-lifecycle-executable-archives).
- 2026-07-24 - `run.record`: new canonical kind carrying the verbatim input,
  log and attachments of a program invocation, with a required `program`
  section field. No `qvf_version` bump.
  [Decision](GOVERNANCE.md#2026-07-24--runrecord-canonical-kind-added-self-contained-archives).
- 2026-07-10 - `qvf_version: 2` withdrawn: `reaction.path` gains an optional
  `lattice` member under v1. Producers MUST NOT emit `qvf_version: 2`;
  consumers SHOULD accept it and treat it as `1`. The frozen schema for
  already-stamped archives is kept at
  [`spec/legacy/qvf_manifest_v2.schema.json`](spec/legacy/qvf_manifest_v2.schema.json).
  [Decision](GOVERNANCE.md#2026-07-10--qvf_version-2-withdrawn-periodic-reactionpath).
- 2026-07-10 - `structure`: the member payload is schema'd as
  `$defs/StructurePayload`; `pbc` is required whenever `lattice_vectors` is
  non-null, and `dimensionality` is optional and derived
  (`dimensionality == sum(pbc)`). No `qvf_version` bump.
  [Decision](GOVERNANCE.md#2026-07-10--structure-payload-schemad-pbc-required-when-periodic).

### Toolkit

- Normative specification
  ([`spec/qvf-format-spec.md`](spec/qvf-format-spec.md)) and the JSON Schema
  for `manifest.json`
  ([`spec/qvf_manifest.schema.json`](spec/qvf_manifest.schema.json)), kept in
  step with the registry by a drift test.
- Reference writer in Python ([`python/qvf_writer.py`](python/qvf_writer.py);
  standard library and NumPy only) and in C++17 (`qvf::QvfWriter` under
  [`cpp/`](cpp/); no external build dependencies).
- Reference reader and validator in Python
  ([`python/qvf_reader.py`](python/qvf_reader.py)) and in C++17.
- C ABI in [`cpp/include/qvf/qvf_c.h`](cpp/include/qvf/qvf_c.h), covering
  about a third of the canonical kinds.
- Conformance suite: a golden corpus of 12 archives and a runner
  ([`conformance/`](conformance/)); the reference writer and reader are
  certified against it in CI.
- Single-header amalgamation
  ([`cpp/qvf_single.hpp`](cpp/qvf_single.hpp)), generated by
  [`scripts/amalgamate.py`](scripts/amalgamate.py) and checked for staleness
  in CI.
- CMake package export (`qvf::` targets) and a PyPI-ready Python package
  (not yet published).
- Governance documents: [`GOVERNANCE.md`](GOVERNANCE.md) and
  [`registry.json`](registry.json), the registry of canonical kinds and
  vendor namespaces. `spectra.epr` was promoted ahead of the two-producer
  threshold as a maintainer decision (see "Vendor → canonical promotion" in
  `GOVERNANCE.md`).
